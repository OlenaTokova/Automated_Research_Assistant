An Optimal Control View of Adversarial Machine Learning,"  I describe an optimal control view of adversarial machine learning, where the
dynamical system is the machine learner, the input are adversarial actions, and
the control costs are defined by the adversary's goals to do harm and be hard
to detect. This view encompasses many types of adversarial machine learning,
including test-item attacks, training-data poisoning, and adversarial reward
shaping. The view encourages adversarial machine learning researcher to utilize
advances in control theory and reinforcement learning.

"Minimax deviation strategies for machine learning and recognition with
  short learning samples","  The article is devoted to the problem of small learning samples in machine
learning. The flaws of maximum likelihood learning and minimax learning are
looked into and the concept of minimax deviation learning is introduced that is
free of those flaws.

Machine Learning for Clinical Predictive Analytics,"  In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of applying machine learning
techniques for clinical prediction tasks. We begin with a quick introduction to
the concepts of machine learning and outline some of the most common machine
learning algorithms. Next, we demonstrate how to apply the algorithms with
appropriate toolkits to conduct machine learning experiments for clinical
prediction tasks. The objectives of this chapter are to (1) understand the
basics of machine learning techniques and the reasons behind why they are
useful for solving clinical prediction problems, (2) understand the intuition
behind some machine learning models, including regression, decision trees, and
support vector machines, and (3) understand how to apply these models to
clinical prediction problems using publicly available datasets via case
studies.

"Towards Modular Machine Learning Solution Development: Benefits and
  Trade-offs","  Machine learning technologies have demonstrated immense capabilities in
various domains. They play a key role in the success of modern businesses.
However, adoption of machine learning technologies has a lot of untouched
potential. Cost of developing custom machine learning solutions that solve
unique business problems is a major inhibitor to far-reaching adoption of
machine learning technologies. We recognize that the monolithic nature
prevalent in today's machine learning applications stands in the way of
efficient and cost effective customized machine learning solution development.
In this work we explore the benefits of modular machine learning solutions and
discuss how modular machine learning solutions can overcome some of the major
solution engineering limitations of monolithic machine learning solutions. We
analyze the trade-offs between modular and monolithic machine learning
solutions through three deep learning problems; one text based and the two
image based. Our experimental results show that modular machine learning
solutions have a promising potential to reap the solution engineering
advantages of modularity while gaining performance and data advantages in a way
the monolithic machine learning solutions do not permit.

Recent Advances in Optimal Transport for Machine Learning,"  Recently, Optimal Transport has been proposed as a probabilistic framework in
Machine Learning for comparing and manipulating probability distributions. This
is rooted in its rich history and theory, and has offered new solutions to
different problems in machine learning, such as generative modeling and
transfer learning. In this survey we explore contributions of Optimal Transport
for Machine Learning over the period 2012 -- 2022, focusing on four sub-fields
of Machine Learning: supervised, unsupervised, transfer and reinforcement
learning. We further highlight the recent development in computational Optimal
Transport, and its interplay with Machine Learning practice.

The Tribes of Machine Learning and the Realm of Computer Architecture,"  Machine learning techniques have influenced the field of computer
architecture like many other fields. This paper studies how the fundamental
machine learning techniques can be applied towards computer architecture
problems. We also provide a detailed survey of computer architecture research
that employs different machine learning methods. Finally, we present some
future opportunities and the outstanding challenges that need to be overcome to
exploit full potential of machine learning for computer architecture.

"A Machine Learning Tutorial for Operational Meteorology, Part I:
  Traditional Machine Learning","  Recently, the use of machine learning in meteorology has increased greatly.
While many machine learning methods are not new, university classes on machine
learning are largely unavailable to meteorology students and are not required
to become a meteorologist. The lack of formal instruction has contributed to
perception that machine learning methods are 'black boxes' and thus end-users
are hesitant to apply the machine learning methods in their every day workflow.
To reduce the opaqueness of machine learning methods and lower hesitancy
towards machine learning in meteorology, this paper provides a survey of some
of the most common machine learning methods. A familiar meteorological example
is used to contextualize the machine learning methods while also discussing
machine learning topics using plain language. The following machine learning
methods are demonstrated: linear regression; logistic regression; decision
trees; random forest; gradient boosted decision trees; naive Bayes; and support
vector machines. Beyond discussing the different methods, the paper also
contains discussions on the general machine learning process as well as best
practices to enable readers to apply machine learning to their own datasets.
Furthermore, all code (in the form of Jupyter notebooks and Google Colaboratory
notebooks) used to make the examples in the paper is provided in an effort to
catalyse the use of machine learning in meteorology.
"
Position Paper: Towards Transparent Machine Learning,"  Transparent machine learning is introduced as an alternative form of machine
learning, where both the model and the learning system are represented in
source code form. The goal of this project is to enable direct human
understanding of machine learning models, giving us the ability to learn,
verify, and refine them as programs. If solved, this technology could represent
a best-case scenario for the safety and security of AI systems going forward.
