  Generating matrices",http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05127v1,"In this paper, firstly, we define the Qq-generating matrix for bi-periodic
Fibonacci polynomial. And we give nth power, determinant and some properties of
the bi-periodic Fibonacci polynomial by considering this matrix representation.
Also, we introduce the Hadamard products for bi-periodic Fibonacci Qnq

2,"Auto-BI: Automatically Build BI-Models Leveraging Local Join Prediction
  and Global Schema Graph",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12515v1,"Business Intelligence (BI) is crucial in modern enterprises and
billion-dollar business. Traditionally, technical experts like database
administrators would manually prepare BI-models (e.g., in star or snowflake
schemas) that join tables in data warehouses, before less-technical business
users can run analytics using end-user dashboarding tools. However, the
popularity of self-service BI (e.g., Tableau and Power-BI) in recent years
creates a strong demand for less technical end-users to build BI-models
themselves.
  We develop an Auto-BI system that can accurately predict BI models given a
set of input tables, using a principled graph-based optimization problem we
propose called \textit{k-Min-Cost-Arborescence} (k-MCA), which holistically
considers both local join prediction and global schema-graph structures,
leveraging a graph-theoretical structure called \textit{arborescence}. While we
prove k-MCA is intractable and inapproximate in general, we develop novel
algorithms that can solve k-MCA optimally, which is shown to be efficient in
practice with sub-second latency and can scale to the largest BI-models we
encounter (with close to 100 tables).
  Auto-BI is rigorously evaluated on a unique dataset with over 100K real BI
models we harvested, as well as on 4 popular TPC benchmarks. It is shown to be
both efficient and accurate, achieving over 0.9 F1-score on both real and
synthetic benchmarks."
3,"Thermoelectric power of Bi and Bi(1-x)Te(x), x=0.0014,in porous Vycor
  glass",http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0311112v1,"Semiconductor quantum wires constitute a promising thermoelectric material
because of the increase of the electronic density of states in low-dimensional
materials. We studied the magnetic-field-dependent resistance and Seebeck
coefficient of a high-density network of 6-nm-diameter wires of Bi and of
Bi(1-x)Te(x), x=0.0014, in porous Vycor glass. The resistance R increases as
temperature decreases from 300 K down to 0.3 K for both composites. However, in
contrast to recent results that demonstrate the semiconducting behavior of the
resistance and very large enhancements of the thermoelectric power of
composites containing Bi nanowires with diameters of 9 and 15 nm, we find that
the resistance is not thermally activated and that the thermoelectric power of
the composites is of the same order of magnitude as the thermoelectric power of
bulk Bi. Our results are consistent with the nanowires having carrier density
that is enhanced by surface effects."

  strategy: First-principles study",http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01723v1,"By performing first principles calculations combined with Boltzmann transport
equations, we calculate the thermoelectric power factor (PF) of Bi-Sb-Te and

also perform to search potential n-type dopant candidates in ternaries."
5,"Effect of Bi-substitution on Structural Stability and Improved
  Thermoelectric Performance of p-type Half-Heusler TaSbRu: A First-principles
  Study",http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12564v1,"Recently, Fang et al. have predicted a high ZT of 1.54 in TaSbRu alloys at
1200 K from first-principles without considering spin-orbit interaction,
accurate electronic structure, details of phonon scattering, and
energy-dependent holes relaxation time. Here, we report the details of
structural stability and thermoelectric performance of Bi-Substituted p-type
TaSbRu from first-principles calculations considering theses important
parameters. This indirect bandgap semiconductor (Eg=0.8 eV by TB-mBJ+SOC) has
highly dispersive and degenerate valence bands, which lead to a maximum power
factor, 3.8 mWm-1K-2 at 300K. As Sb-5p has a small contribution to the bandgap
formation, the substitution of Bi on the Sb site does not cause significant
change to the electronic structure. Although the Seebeck coefficient increases
by Bi due to slight changes in the bandgap, electrical conductivity, and hence,
the power factor reduces to ~3 mW m-1K-2 at 300K (50% Bi). On the other side,
lattice thermal conductivity drops effectively to 5 from 20 W/m K as Bi
introduces a significant contribution in the acoustic phonon region and
intensify phonon scattering. Thus, ZT value is improved through
Bi-substitution, reaching 1.1 (50% Bi) at 1200 K from 0.45 (pure TaSbRu) only.
Therefore, the present study suggests how to improve the TE performance of
Sb-based half-Heusler compounds and TaSbRu (with 50% Bi) is a promising
material for high-temperature applications."
6,"Rotatory power reversal induced by magnetic-current in bi-isotropic
  media",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03888v1,"Bi-isotropic media constitute a proper scenario for scrutinizing optical
effects stemming from magnetoelectric parameters. Chiral magnetic current is a
macroscopic effect arising from the chiral magnetic effect that enriches the
phenomenology of a classical dielectric medium. This work examines optical
aspects of bi-isotropic media in the presence of magnetic conductivity. The
full isotropic scenario manifests circular birefringence described by a
dispersive rotatory power that changes sign at a given frequency. For a
bi-isotropic medium with antisymmetric magnetic conductivity, an intricate
dispersive rotatory power is attained, supplied with sign reversal as well.
This scenario also indicates a handedness reversion of the medium, an unusual
property in dielectrics, which may work as a signature of bi-isotropic media
supporting chiral magnetic current."
7,"Navigating the acceptance of implementing business intelligence in
  organizations: A system dynamics approach",http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10244v1,"The rise of information technology has transformed the business landscape,
with organizations increasingly relying on information systems to collect and
store vast amounts of data. To stay competitive, businesses must harness this
data to make informed decisions that optimize their actions in response to the
market. Business intelligence (BI) is an approach that enables organizations to
leverage data-driven insights for better decision-making, but implementing BI
comes with its own set of challenges. Accordingly, understanding the key
factors that contribute to successful implementation is crucial.
  This study examines the factors affecting the implementation of BI projects
by analyzing the interactions between these factors using system dynamics
modeling. The research draws on interviews with five BI experts and a review of
the background literature to identify effective implementation strategies.
Specifically, the study compares traditional and self-service implementation
approaches and simulates their respective impacts on organizational acceptance
of BI. The results show that the two approaches were equally effective in
generating organizational acceptance until the twenty-fifth month of
implementation, after which the self-service strategy generated significantly
higher levels of acceptance than the traditional strategy. In fact, after 60
months, the self-service approach was associated with a 30% increase in
organizational acceptance over the traditional approach. The paper also
provides recommendations for increasing the acceptance of BI in both
implementation strategies. Overall, this study underscores the importance of
identifying and addressing key factors that impact BI implementation success,
offering practical guidance to organizations seeking to leverage the power of
BI in today's competitive business environment."

9,"Strategy for enhanced thermoelectric performance of Bi2S3 nanorods by Bi
  nanoinclusions",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03003v1,"This is the first report on the enhanced thermoelectric (TE) properties of
novel Bi2S3-Bi nanocomposites synthesized using a one-step polyol method at
different reaction temperatures (TRe) and time. They are well-characterized as
nanorod-composites, coexistent with orthorhombic Bi2S3 and rhombohedral Bi
phases together in which the latter coats the former forming Bi2S3-Bi
core-shell type structures along with independent Bi nanoparticles (NPs). There
is a very significant observation of systematic reduction in electri-cal
resistivity \r{ho} with reaction temperature and time duration increase,
revealing a promising approach for reduction of \r{ho} in this highly resistive
Bi2S3 and hence resolving the earlier obstacles for its thermoelectric
application potentials for the past few decades. Most astonishingly, TE power
factor at 300 K of highest Bi content nanocomposite pellet, made at 27 oC using
~900 MPa pressure, is 3 orders of magnitude greater than that of hot-pressed
Bi2S3, or even 23% better than that of spark plasma-sintered core-shell
Bi2S3@Bi sample reported earlier (Tarachand et al. Nano Res. 2016, 9, 3291; Ge
et al. ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2017, 9, 4828). Considering the probable
greatly reduced thermal conductivity due to their complex nanostructures, the
significantly improved TE performance potential near 300 K is highly
anticipated for these toxic- and rare earth element-free TE nanocomposites,
making the present synthesis method as a pioneering approach for developing
enhanced thermoelectric properties of Bi2S3-based materials without using extra
sintering steps."

  magnetic, chiral, and bi-anisotropic materials",http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08883v1,"The resonant-state expansion, a recently developed powerful method in
electrodynamics, is generalized here for open optical systems containing
magnetic, chiral, or bi-anisotropic materials. It is shown that the key matrix
eigenvalue equation of the method remains the same, but the matrix elements of
the perturbation now contain variations of the permittivity, permeability, and
bi-anisotropy tensors. A general normalization of resonant states in terms of
the electric and magnetic fields is presented."

that $G$ is normal in the full automorphism group ${\rm Aut}(\Gamma)$ of
$\Gamma$ when $G$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of ${\rm Aut}(\Gamma)$. As an
application, we classify half-arc-transitive bipartite bi-Cayley graphs over
the group $G$ of valency less than $2p$. Furthermore, it is shown that there
are no semisymmetric and no arc-transitive bipartite bi-Cayley graphs over the

  material",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00840v1,"Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is a wide-band-gap semiconductor promising for UV
sensors and high power transistor applications, with Baliga's figure of merit
that far exceeds those of GaN and SiC, second only to diamond. Engineering its
band structure through alloying will broaden its range of applications. Using
hybrid density functional calculations we study the effects on adding Bi to
Ga2O3. While in III-V semiconductors, such as GaAs and InAs, Bi tend to
substitute on the pnictide site, we find that in Ga2O3, Bi prefers to
substitute on the Ga site, resulting in dilute (Ga_{1-x}Bi_{x})2O3 alloys with
unique electronic structure properties. Adding a few percent of Bi reduces the
band gap of Ga2O3 by introducing an intermediate valence band that is
significantly higher in energy than the valence band of the host material. This
intermediate valence band is composed mainly of Bi 6s and O 2p orbitals, and it
is sufficiently high in energy to provide opportunity for p-type doping."
13,"Devices for Thermal Conductivity Measurements of Electroplated Bi for
  X-ray TES Absorbers",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02503v1,"Electroplated Bismuth (Bi) is commonly used in Transition-Edge Sensors (TESs)
for X-rays because of its high stopping power and low heat capacity.
Electroplated Bi is usually grown on top of another metal that acts as seed
layer, typically gold (Au), making it challenging to extrapolate its
thermoelectric properties. In this work, we present four-wire resistance
measurement structures that allow us to measure resistance as a function of
temperature of electroplated Bi independently of Au. The results show that the
thermal conductivity of the Bi at 3 K is high enough to guarantee the correct
thermalization of X-ray photons when used as an absorber for TESs."
14,"Microstructure analysis of bismuth absorbers for transition-edge sensor
  X-ray microcalorimeters",http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02215v1,"Transition-edge sensors (TESs) as microcalorimeters offer high resolving
power, owning to their sharp response and low operating temperature. In the
hard X-ray regime and above, the demand for high quantum-efficiency requires
the use of absorbers. Bismuth (Bi), owing to its low heat carrier density and
high X-ray stopping power, has been widely used as an absorber material for
TESs. However, distinct spectral responses have been observed for Bi absorbers
deposited via evaporation versus electroplating. Evaporated Bi absorbers are
widely observed to have a non-Gaussian tail on the low energy side of measured
spectra. In this study, we fabricated Bi absorbers via these two methods, and
performed microstructure analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
X-ray diffraction microscopy. The two types of material showed the same
crystallographic structure, but the grain size of the evaporated Bi was about
40 times smaller than that of the electroplated Bi. This distinction in grain
size is likely to be the cause of their different spectral responses."
15,"Reinforcement Learning-Based Cooperative P2P Power Trading between DC
  Nanogrid Clusters with Wind and PV Energy Resources",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07744v2,"In replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy resources for carbon
neutrality, the unbalanced resource production of intermittent wind and
photovoltaic (PV) power is a critical issue for peer-to-peer (P2P) power
trading. To address this issue, a reinforcement learning (RL) technique is
introduced in this paper. For RL, a graph convolutional network (GCN) and a
bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network are jointly applied to
P2P power trading between nanogrid clusters, based on cooperative game theory.
The flexible and reliable DC nanogrid is suitable for integrating renewable
energy for a distribution system. Each local nanogrid cluster takes the
position of prosumer, focusing on power production and consumption
simultaneously. For the power management of nanogrid cluster, multi-objective
optimization is applied to each local nanogrid cluster with the Internet of
Things (IoT) technology. Charging/discharging of an electric vehicle (EV) is
executed considering the intermittent characteristics of wind and PV power
production. RL algorithms, such as GCN- convolutional neural network (CNN)
layers for deep Q-learning network (DQN), GCN-LSTM layers for deep recurrent
Q-learning network (DRQN), GCN-Bi-LSTM layers for DRQN, and GCN-Bi-LSTM layers
for proximal policy optimization (PPO), are used for simulations. Consequently,
the cooperative P2P power trading system maximizes the profit by considering
the time of use (ToU) tariff-based electricity cost and the system marginal
price (SMP), and minimizes the amount of grid power consumption. Power
management of nanogrid clusters with P2P power trading is simulated on a
distribution test feeder in real time, and the proposed GCN-Bi-LSTM-PPO
technique achieving the lowest electricity cost among the RL algorithms used
for comparison reduces the electricity cost by 36.7%, averaging over nanogrid
clusters."

  System",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08613v2,"The optimization of secondary phase in thermoelectric(TE) materials can
{helps in improvisation of material's efficiency}. Being a potential
{contender} for lower temperature TE application, bismuth
telluride(Bi$_2$Te$_3$) nanoparticles were synthesized via different routes and
profiles to optimize their pure single phase. Systematic characterizations were
performed with the help of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rietveld refinement and
field effect-scanning electron microscopy(FE-SEM) for structural and
morphological behavior, while TE properties such as Seebeck coefficient,
electrical conductivity and power-factor were measured for the purest sample
chosen. Rietveld refinement in the XRD pattern of the samples revealed that
only a small amount ($\sim$ 1.6\%) of Bi$_2$Te$_3$ was formed in
co-precipitation method, while the hydrothermal technique increases this phase
with increment in synthesis duration. This work focused on the phase evolution
of Bi$_2$Te$_3$ with increasing synthesis duration time at constant temperature
and vice-versa. XRD and Rietveld refinement revealed that the hydrothermal
technique (150 $^\circ$C for 48 hours) can synthesize purest samples (84\%
Bi$_2$Te$_3$ phase in this case). {FE-SEM and Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis
unveiled that the impure phases in the system {were} quantitatively reduced,

with increase in temperature.} The observed electrical conductivity of the
chosen sample is $\sim$20 times greater, while Seebeck coefficient is $\sim$3

  Summary Data",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06887v1,"Mendelian randomization (MR) is a powerful method that uses genetic variants
as instrumental variables (IVs) to infer the causal effect of a modifiable

basic MR methods to be robust to certain violations of assumptions, few methods
were proposed to infer bi-directional causal relationships, especially for
phenotypes with limited biological understandings. The presence of horizontal
pleiotropy adds another layer of complexity. In this article, we show that
assumptions for common MR methods are often impossible or too stringent in the
existence of bi-directional relationships. We then propose a new focusing
framework for testing bi-directional causal effects between two traits with
possibly pleiotropic genetic variants. Our proposal can be coupled with many
state-of-art MR methods. We provide theoretical guarantees on the Type I error
and power of the proposed methods. We demonstrate the robustness of the
proposed methods using several simulated and real datasets."

  Distribution Grid Implementation",http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03086v1,"As electric vehicle (EV) adoption is growing year after year, there is no
doubt that EVs will occupy a significant portion of transporting vehicle in the
near future. Although EVs have benefits for environment, large amount of

quality. To alleviate negative effects of EV charging load and turn them to
opportunities, a decentralized real-time control algorithm is developed in this
paper to provide optimal scheduling of EV bi-directional charging. To evaluate
the performance of the proposed algorithm, numerical simulation is performed
based on real-world EV user data, and power flow analysis is carried out to
show how the proposed algorithm improve power grid steady state operation. .
The results show that the implementation of proposed algorithm can effectively
coordinate bi-directional charging by 30% peak load shaving, more than 2% of

19,"Hamiltonicity of bi-power of bipartite graphs, for finite and infinite

theorem states that the square of every 2-connected finite graph has a
Hamiltonian cycle. Georgakopoulos prove that the square of every 2-connected

consider the Hamiltonicity of the bi-power of bipartite graphs. We show that
for every connected finite bipartite graph $G$ with a perfect matching, $G_B^3$

20,$V$-universal Hopf algebras (co)acting on $Ω$-algebras,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12954v4,"We develop a theory which unifies the universal (co)acting bi/Hopf algebras

family of linear maps between tensor powers of $A$, called $\Omega$-algebras.
This allows us to treat algebras, coalgebras, braided vector spaces and many
other structures in a unified way. We study $V$-universal measuring coalgebras
and $V$-universal comeasuring algebras between $\Omega$-algebras $A$ and $B$,
relative to a fixed subspace $V$ of $\Vect(A,B)$. By considering the case
$A=B$, we derive the notion of a $V$-universal (co)acting bialgebra (and Hopf
algebra) for a given algebra $A$. In particular, this leads to a refinement of
the existence conditions for the Manin--Tambara universal coacting bi/Hopf
algebras. We establish an isomorphism between the $V$-universal acting bi/Hopf

thermometry using ScVO$_4$:Bi$^{3+}$. MPE is performed using a 37 fs
Ti:Sapphire laser pulse centred at 800 nm. Log-log plots of the phosphorescence
intensity versus excitation power show that the 800 nm MPE of
ScVO$_4$:Bi$^{3+}$ involves a 2- and 3-photon absorption process in comparison
to a single-photon excitation (SPE) process at 266 nm and 400 nm. Spectroscopic
investigation shows that with the 800 nm MPE and 266 nm SPE schemes, the
emission spectra of ScVO$_4$:Bi$^{3+}$ are similarly characterized by emissions
of the VO$_4^{3-}$ groups and Bi$^{3+}$. The MPE is advantageous to suppress
fluorescence which interfere with the phosphorescence signal. We demonstrate
this aspect for a ScVO$_4$:Bi$^{3+}$ coating applied on an alumina substrate.
The luminescence lifetime is calibrated with temperature over 294-334 K; the
MPE scheme has an equally impressive temperature sensitivity (3.4-1.7% / K) and
precision (0.2-0.7K) compared to the SPE schemes. The MPE scheme can be applied
to a variety of phosphors and is valuable for precise temperature measurements

The three cases examined have provided real and distinct refractive indices for
two propagating modes, which implies birefringence. The propagating modes were
also carried out in all cases. The anisotropy or birefringence effect, given by
the rotatory power or phase difference, was evaluated in terms of the
magnetoelectric parameters of the theory in each case. The propagation
orthogonal to the vectors used to parametrize the symmetric and antisymmetric
magnetoelectric tensors is described by distinct modes, representing a route to

building block of the ICT system, power system state estimation is of critical
importance to maintain normal operation of the smart grid, which, however, is

provides intuitive visualization of some complex problem structures and enables
efficient graphical solution algorithms, which are useful for both defending

to compute a suboptimal power-split strategy for power/energy management in a
parallel hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). The power-split strategy is obtained
as model predictive control solution to the power management control problem
(PMCP) of the PHEV, i.e., to decide upon the power distribution among the
internal combustion engine, an electric drive, and other subsystems. A
hierarchical control structure of the hybrid vehicle, i.e., supervisory level
and local or subsystem level is assumed in this study. The PMCP consists of a
dynamical nonlinear model, and a performance index, both of which are
formulated for power flows at the supervisory level. The model is described as
a bi-modal switched system, consistent with the operating mode of the electric
ED. The performance index prescribing the desired behavior penalizes vehicle
tracking errors, fuel consumption, and frictional losses, as well as sustaining
the battery state of charge (SOC). The power-split strategy is obtained by
first creating the embedded optimal control problem (EOCP) from the original
bi-modal switched system model with the performance index. Direct collocation
is applied to transform the problem into a nonlinear programming problem. A
nonlinear predictive control technique (NMPC) in conjunction with a sequential
quadratic programming solver is used to compute suboptimal numerical solutions
to the PMCP. Methods for approximating the numerical solution to the EOCP with
trajectories of the original bi-modal PHEV are also presented in this paper.
The usefulness of the approach is illustrated via simulation results on several
case studies."

quasars using both the VLBA and EVN at 5 GHz. All the selected sources have
balnicity indices (BI) more than 0 and radio flux densities less than 80 mJy at
1.4 GHz. They are very compact with linear sizes of the order of a few tens of
parsecs and radio luminosities at 1.4 GHz above the FRI-FRII luminosity
threshold. Most of the observed objects have been resolved at 5 GHz showing
one-sided, probably core-jet structures, typical for quasars. We discuss in
detail their age and orientation based on the radio observations. We then used
the largest available sample of BAL quasars to study the relationships between
the radio and optical properties in these objects. We found that (1) the
strongest absorption (high values of the balnicity index BI) is connected with
the lower values of the radio-loudness parameter, logR_I<1.5, and thus probably
with large viewing angles; (2) the large span of the BI values in each bin of
the radio-loudness parameter indicates that the orientation is only one of the
factors influencing the measured absorption; (3) most of the radio-loud BAL
quasars are compact, low luminosity objects with a wide range of jet power
(although the highest values of BI seem to be associated with the lower values
of jet power). In addition, we suggest that the short lifetime postulated for
some compact AGNs could also explain the scarcity of the large-scale radio
sources among BAL quasars."
27,"Importance of spin-orbit coupling in power factor calculations for
  half-Heusler ANiB (A=Ti, Hf, Sc, Y; B=Sn, Sb, Bi)",http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07710v1,"We investigate the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects on the electronic
structures and semi-classic transport coefficients of half-Heusler
$\mathrm{ANiB}$ (A=Ti, Hf, Sc, Y; B=Sn, Sb, Bi) by using generalized gradient
approximation (GGA). Calculated results show that SOC splits the valence bands
at high symmetry $\Gamma$ point, and modifies the outline of $\Gamma$-centered
valence bands, which has remarkable effects on the electron transport
properties. Thermoelectric properties are performed through solving Boltzmann
transport equations within the constant scattering time approximation. It is
found that the compounds containing Sn atom have larger power factor in p-type
doping than ones in n-type doping, and it is just the opposite for compounds
containing Sb and Bi elements. The SOC has obvious detrimental influence on
power factor in p-type doping, while has a negligible effect in n-type doping.
These can be understood by considering the effects of SOC on the valence bands
and conduction bands. The maximum power factors (MPF) are extracted in n-type
and p-type doping with GGA and GGA+SOC, and the MPF at 300 K with SOC is
predicted to be about 4.25\%$\sim$44.13\% smaller than that without SOC in the
case of p-type doping for $\mathrm{ANiB}$ (A=Ti, Hf, Sc, Y; B=Sn, Sb, Bi).
Therefore, it is crucial to consider SOC effects for theoretical analysis in
the case of p-type doping in half-Heusler compounds composed of heavy elements."

  Bi-anisotropic Particles",http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4726v1,"The least upper bounds of the powers extracted and scattered by
bi-anisotropic particles are investigated analytically. A rigorous derivation
for particles having invertible polarizability tensors is presented, and the
particles with singular polarizability tensors that have been reported in the

bounds presented for isotropic particles can be extrapolated to bi-anisotropic
particles. In particular, it is shown that neither nonreciprocal nor
magnetoelectric coupling phenomena can further increase those upper bounds on
the extracted and scattered powers. The outcomes are illustrated further with
approximate circuit model examples of two dipole antennas connected via a
generic lossless network."

  and bi-modality using Planck data",http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2856v3,"Giant radio haloes in galaxy clusters are the primary evidence for the
existence of relativistic particles (cosmic rays) and magnetic fields over Mpc
scales. Observational tests for the different theoretical models explaining
their powering mechanism have so far been obtained through X-ray selection of
clusters, e.g. by comparing cluster X-ray luminosities with radio halo power.
Here we present the first global scaling relations between radio halo power and
integrated Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect measurements, using the Planck
all-sky cluster catalog and published radio data. The correlation agrees well
with previous scaling measurements based on X-ray data, and offers a more
direct probe into the mass dependence inside radio haloes. However, we find no
strong indication for a bi-modal cluster population split between radio halo
and radio quiet objects. We discuss the possible causes for this apparent lack
of bi-modality, and compare the observed slope of the radio-SZ correlation with
competing theoretical models of radio halo origin."

found that the strong SOC in this material results in weak antilocalization
(WAL) effect, which can be well described by the three-dimensional weak
localization model. The phase coherence length extracted from theoretical
fitting exhibits a power-law temperature dependence with an exponent around
2.1, indicating that the electron phase dephasing is governed by electron -
transverse phonon interactions. Like in topological insulators, the WAL effect
in $\beta$-K$_{2}$Bi$_{8}$Se$_{13}$ can be quenched by magnetic impurities (Mn)
but is robust against non-magnetic impurities (Te). Although our

extraction techniques that has been successfully applied in many fields, namely

formulation. In this paper, we propose to revisit the NMF as a multi-objective
problem, in particular a bi-objective one, where the objective functions
defined in both input and feature spaces are taken into account. By taking the
advantage of the sum-weighted method from the literature of multi-objective
optimization, the proposed bi-objective NMF determines a set of nondominated,
Pareto optimal, solutions instead of a single optimal decomposition. Moreover,
the corresponding Pareto front is studied and approximated. Experimental
results on unmixing real hyperspectral images confirm the efficiency of the
proposed bi-objective NMF compared with the state-of-the-art methods."

on AF images provided deeper insight into the microscopic details of the
surface topography. For different etching time, it has been shown that the
average frequency of visiting a height with positive slope behaves Gaussian for
heights near the mean value and obeys power law for the heights far away from
the mean value. Finally, by applying the generalized total number of crossings

to increase the density of the superconducting filaments and therefore
decreasing the bubble density: much higher critical currents have been reached
always acting on the final as-drawn wires. We here try to pursue the same goal
of having a denser wire by acting on the deformation technique, through a
partial use of the groove-rolling at different wire processing stages. Such
technique has a larger powders compaction power, is straightforwardly adaptable
to long length samples, and allows the fabrication of samples with round,
square or rectangular shape depending on the application requirements. In this
paper we demonstrate the capability of this technique to increase the density
in Bi-2212 wires which leads to a three-fold increase in Jc with respect to

superconducting and non-superconducting heavily overdoped regimes of
high-temperature superconducting copper oxides, using
(Bi,Pb)_2_Sr_2_CuO_6+delta_ (Bi-2201) single crystals. Magnetization curves
exhibit a tendency to be saturated in high magnetic fields at low temperatures
in the heavily overdoped crystals, which is probably a precursor phenomenon of
a FM transition at a lower temperature. Muon spin relaxation detects the
enhancement of spin fluctuations at high temperatures below 200 K.
Correspondingly, the ab-plane resistivity follows a 4/3 power law in a wide
temperature range, which is characteristic of metals with two-dimensional FM
fluctuations due to itinerant electrons. As the Wilson ratio evidences the
enhancement of spin fluctuations with hole doping in the heavily overdoped
regime, it is concluded that two-dimensional FM fluctuations reside in the
heavily overdoped Bi-2201 cuprates, which is probably related to the decrease
in the superconducting transition temperature in the heavily overdoped
cuprates."

magnetic flux into an electrical output with excellent sensitivity,
integrability and power consumption. Yet, their voltage response is
intrinsically non-linear, a limitation which is conventionally circumvented
through the introduction of compensation inductances or by the construction of
complex device arrays. Here we propose an intrinsically-linear flux-to-voltage
mesoscopic transducer, called bi-SQUIPT, based on the superconducting quantum
interference proximity transistor as fundamental building block. The bi-SQUIPT
provides a voltage-noise spectral density as low as $\sim10^{-16}$ V/Hz$^{1/2}$
and, more interestingly, under a proper operation parameter selection, exhibits
a spur-free dynamic range as large as $\sim60$ dB, a value on par with that
obtained with state-of-the-art SQUID-based linear flux-to-voltage
superconducting transducers. Furthermore, thanks to its peculiar measurement
configuration, the bi-SQUIPT is tolerant to imperfections and non-idealities in
general. For the above reasons, we believe that the bi-SQUIPT could provide a
relevant step-beyond in the field of low-dissipation and low-noise current

Functions (VNFs), known as VNF chains. Furthermore, many existing network
devices (e.g., switches) and collocated PMs are underutilized or
over-provisioned, resulting in low power-efficiency. In order to achieve more
energy efficient systems, this work aims at designing the placement of VNFs
such that the total power consumption in network nodes and PMs is minimized,
while meeting the delay and capacity requirements of the foreseen demands.
Based on existing switch and PM power models, we propose a Integer Linear
Programming (ILP) formulation to find the optimal solution. We also propose a
heuristic based on the concept of Blocking Islands (BI), and a baseline
heuristic based on the Betweenness Centrality (BC) property of the graph. Both
heuristics and the ILP solutions have been compared in terms of total power
consumption, delay, demands acceptance rate, and computation time. Our
simulation results suggest that BI-based heuristic is superior compared with
the BC-based heuristic, and very close to the optimal solution obtained from
the ILP in terms of total power consumption and demands acceptance rate.
Compared to the ILP, the proposed BI-based heuristic is significantly faster
and results in 22% lower end-to-end delay, with a penalty of consuming 6% more
power in average."

  displacement",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13517v1,"In this study, we classify the COVID-19 anomalous diffusion in two categories
of countries based on the mean squared displacement (MSD) of daily new cases,
which includes the top four countries and four randomly selected countries in
terms of the total cases. The COVID-19 diffusion is a stochastic process, and
the daily new cases are regarded as the displacements of diffusive particles.
The diffusion environment of COVID-19 in each country is heterogeneous, in
which the underlying dynamic process is anomalous diffusion. The calculated MSD
is a power law function of time, and the power law exponent is not a constant
but varies with time. The power law exponents are estimated by using the
bi-exponential model and the long short-term memory network (LSTM). The
bi-exponential model frequently use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can
quantify the power law exponent and make an easy prediction. The LSTM network
has much better accuracy than the bi-exponential model in predicting the power
law exponent. The LSTM network is more flexible and preferred to predict the
power law exponent, which is independent on the unique mathematical formula.
The diffusion process of COVID-19 can be classified based on the power law
exponent. More specific evaluation and suggestion can be proposed and submitted
to the government in order to control the COVID-19 diffusion."

  Bi$_2$Te$_3$, Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$: a comparison of simple
  scattering approximations",http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06807v1,"Materials with ring-shaped electronic bands are promising thermoelectric
candidates, since their unusual dispersion shape is predicted to give large
power factors. While previous calculations of these materials have relied on
the assumption of a constant mean-free-path or relaxation time, recent
first-principles modeling of electron-phonon scattering suggests that the
scattering rates may be better approximated by the electron density-of-states
(so-called DOS scattering model). In this work, we use density functional
theory to investigate single and double quintuple-layer Bi$_2$Te$_3$,
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$, with a focus on understanding how the three
aforementioned scattering approximations impact thermoelectric performance --
emphasis is placed on the DOS scattering model. The single quintuple-layer
materials possess two ring-shaped valence band maxima that provide an abrupt
increase in conducting channels, which benefits the power factor. Additionally,
below the band edge a ring-shaped minimum, located between the two maxima, is
found to further enhance the thermoelectric performance but only with the DOS
scattering model. This comes from a sharp drop in the DOS, and thus scattering,
just below the ring-shaped minimum. An analytic octic dispersion model is
introduced and shown to qualitatively capture the observed features. The double
quintuple-layer materials display notably worse thermoelectric properties,
since their dispersions are significantly modified compared to the single
quintuple-layer case. The benefits of ring-shaped bands are sensitive to the
alignment of the two ring maxima and to the degree of ring anisotropy. Overall,
single quintuple-layer Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and Bi$_2$Se$_3$ are most promising, with
the DOS scattering model giving the highest power factors."
40,"Thermoelectric Alchemy: Designing A Chemical Analog to PbTe with
  Intrinsic High Band Degeneracy and Low Lattice Thermal Conductivity",http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06433v1,"Improving the figure of merit $zT$ of thermoelectric materials requires
simultaneously a high power factor and low thermal conductivity. An effective
approach for increasing the power factor is to align the band extremum and
achieve high band degeneracy ($\geq$ 12) near the Fermi level as realized in
PbTe [\textcolor{blue}{Pei et. al. \textit{Nature} 473, 66 (2010)}], which
usually relies on band structure engineering, e.g., chemical doping and strain.
However, very few materials could achieve such a high band degeneracy without
heavy doping or suffering impractical strain. By employing state-of-the-art
first-principles methods with direct computation of phonon and carrier
lifetime, we demonstrate that two new full-Heusler compounds Li$_2$TlBi and
Li$_2$InBi, possessing a PbTe-like electronic structure, show exceptionally
high power factors ($\sim$ 20 mWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ at 300 K) and low lattice
thermal conductivities (2.36 and 1.55 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$) at room temperature.
The Tl$^{+}$Bi$^{3-}$ (In$^{+}$Bi$^{3-}$) sublattice forms a rock-salt
structure, and the additional two valence electrons from Li atoms essentially
make these compounds isovalent with Pb$^{2+}$Te$^{2-}$. The larger rock-salt
sublattice of TlBi (InBi) shifts the valence band maximum from L point to the
middle of the $\Sigma$ line, increasing the band degeneracy from fourfold to
twelvefold. On the other hand, resonance bond in the PbTe-like sublattice and
soft Tl-Bi (In-Bi) bonding interaction is responsible for intrinsic low lattice
thermal conductivities. Our results present a novel strategy of designing
high-performance thermoelectric materials."

junctions and with microscopic calculations. It is found that both types of
junctions behave in a qualitatively similar way. Both magnetic field and
temperature suppress superconductivity in the state-conserving manner. This
leads to the characteristic sign-change of tunneling magnetoresistance from the
negative at the sub-gap to the positive at the sum-gap bias. We derived
theoretically and verified experimentally scaling laws of magnetotunneling
characteristics and employ them for accurate extraction of the upper critical
field $H_{c2}$. For Nb an extended region of surface superconductivity at
$H_{c2}<H<H_{c3}$ is observed. The parameters of Bi(Pb)-2212 were obtained from
self-consistent analysis of magnetotunneling data at different levels of bias,
dissipation powers and for different mesa sizes, which precludes the influence
of self-heating. It is found that $H_{c2}(0)$ for Bi(Pb)-2212 is $\simeq 70$ T
and decreases significantly at $T\rightarrow T_c$. The amplitude of sub-gap
magnetoresistance is suppressed exponentially at $T>T_c/2$, but remains
negative, although very small, above $T_c$. This may indicate existence of an
extended fluctuation region, which, however, does not destroy the general
second-order type of the phase transition at $T_c$."

contour of surface band play the dominant role. Experimentally we image the
interference patterns on both Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and Bi$_2$Se$_3$ films by measuring
the local density of states using a scanning tunneling microscope. The observed
decay indices of the standing waves agree excellently with the theoretical
prediction: In Bi$_2$Se$_3$, only a single decay index of -3/2 exists; while in
Bi$_2$Te$_3$ with strongly warped surface band, it varies from -3/2 to -1/2 and
finally to -1 as the energy increases. The -1/2 decay indicates that the
suppression of backscattering due to time-reversal symmetry does not
necessarily lead to a spatial decay rate faster than that in the conventional
two-dimensional electron system. Our formalism can also explain the
characteristic scattering wave vectors of the standing wave caused by
non-magnetic impurities on Bi$_2$Te$_3$."

reflect a bi-modal velocity distribution of the radioactive Ni56 in the ejecta

fraction of SNe with intrinsically bi-modal velocity distributions will appear
as doubly-peaked spectra. Therefore SNe with intrinsic bi-modality are likely
common, especially among the SNe in the low-luminosity part on the Philips
relation (\Delta m15(B) >~ 1.3; ~40% of all SNe Ia). Such bi-modality is
naturally expected from direct collisions of white dwarfs (WDs) due to the
detonation of both WDs and is demonstrated in a 3D 0.64 M_Sun-0.64 M_Sun WD
collision simulation. In the future, with a large sample of nebular spectra and
a comprehensive set of numerical simulations, the collision model can be

properties of the material with focus on the quadrupole splitting. It will be
shown that this splitting measures the energy band inversion induced by
spin-orbit coupling in quantitative agreement with first-principle
calculations. Furthermore, this quadrupole interaction is very unusual as it
can show essentially no angular dependence, e.g., even at the magic angle the
first-order splitting remains. Therefore, it is proposed that the magnetic
field direction is involved in setting the quantization axis for the electrons,
and that their life time leads to a new electronically driven relaxation
mechanism, in particular for quadrupolar nuclei like $^{209}$Bi. While a
quantitative understanding of these effects cannot be given, the results
implicate that NMR can become a powerful tool for the investigation of such

charge carrier mobility slightly decreases upon Bi$^{3+}$ to $R^{3+}$
substitution, the electronic transport properties are significantly improved in
a broad temperature range from 100 K to 800 K. In particular, the electrical
resistivity decreases by two times, while the Seebeck coefficient drops from
323 ${\mu}$V K$^{-1}$ to 238 ${\mu}$V K$^{-1}$ at 800 K. Thus, a power factor
of nearly 3 ${\mu}$W cm$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ is achieved for
Bi$_{0.92}$La$_{0.08}$CuSeO sample at 800 K. Meanwhile, a noticeable decrease
of the lattice thermal conductivity is observed for the substituted samples,

originated from atomic mass fluctuations between $R$ and Bi. Ultimately, a
maximum $zT$ value of nearly 0.34 at 800 K is obtained for the

recurrent neural network (RNN) shows powerful capability in extracting the
features of the temporal sequences. Inspired by this, in this paper, we present
a data-driven approach for underwater acoustic signals separation using deep
learning technology. We use the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)
to explore the features of Time-Frequency (T-F) mask, and propose a T-F mask
aware Bi-LSTM for signal separation. Taking advantage of the sparseness of the
T-F image, the designed Bi-LSTM network is able to extract the discriminative
features for separation, which further improves the separation performance. In
particular, this method breaks through the limitations of the existing methods,
not only achieves good results in multivariate separation, but also effectively
separates signals when mixed with 40dB Gaussian noise signals. The experimental
results show that this method can achieve a $97\%$ guarantee ratio (PSR), and
the average similarity coefficient of the multivariate signal separation is

We have fabricated Bi-Te-based modules with a large-scalable fabrication
process and improved their output performance. The reduction in the
interconnection resistance, using thick electrodes of the flexible printed
circuit, significantly improves the module's output power to 87 mW/cm$^{2}$ at
$\Delta T$ = 70 K, which is 1.3-fold higher than a previous prototype module.
Furthermore, the establishment of the fabrication for the top electrodes by
using the surface mount technology makes it possible to realize a
high-throughput manufacturing of the module. Our durability tests reveal that
there is no significant change in the internal resistance of the module during
10000 cycles of mechanical bending test and 1000 cycles of thermal stress test."
51,"Graphical Methods for Defense Against False-data Injection Attacks on
  Power System State Estimation",http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4151v4,"The normal operation of power system relies on accurate state estimation that
faithfully reflects the physical aspects of the electrical power grids.
However, recent research shows that carefully synthesized false-data injection
attacks can bypass the security system and introduce arbitrary errors to state
estimates. In this paper, we use graphical methods to study defending
mechanisms against false-data injection attacks on power system state
estimation. By securing carefully selected meter measurements, no false data
injection attack can be launched to compromise any set of state variables. We
characterize the optimal protection problem, which protects the state variables
with minimum number of measurements, as a variant Steiner tree problem in a
graph. Based on the graphical characterization, we propose both exact and
reduced-complexity approximation algorithms. In particular, we show that the
proposed tree-pruning based approximation algorithm significantly reduces
computational complexity, while yielding negligible performance degradation
compared with the optimal algorithms. The advantageous performance of the
proposed defending mechanisms is verified in IEEE standard power system
testcases."
52,"Computation Rate Maximization in Wireless Powered MEC with Spread
  Spectrum Multiple Access",http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10258v1,"The integration of mobile edge computing (MEC) and wireless power transfer
(WPT) technologies has recently emerged as an effective solution for extending
battery life and increasing the computing power of wireless devices. In this
paper, we study the resource allocation problem of a multi-user wireless
powered MEC system, where the users share the wireless channel via direct
sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA). In particular, we are
interested in jointly optimizing the task offloading decisions and resource
allocation, to maximize the weighted sum computation rate of all the users in
the network. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer
non-linear programming (MINLP). For a given offloading user set, we implement
an efficient Fractional Programming (FP) approach to mitigate the multi-user
interference in the uplink task offloading. On top of that, we then propose a
Stochastic Local Search algorithm to optimize the offloading decisions.
Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively enhance the
computing performance of a wireless powered MEC with spread spectrum multiple
access compared to other representative benchmark methods."
53,"Compressed Air Energy Storage-Part II: Application to Power System Unit
  Commitment",http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08275v2,"Unit commitment (UC) is one of the most important power system operation
problems. To integrate higher penetration of wind power into power systems,
more compressed air energy storage (CAES) plants are being built. Existing
cavern models for the CAES used in power system optimization problems are not
accurate, which may lead to infeasible solutions, e.g., the air pressure in the
cavern is outside its operating range. In this regard, an accurate CAES model
is proposed for the UC problem based on the accurate bi-linear cavern model
proposed in the first paper of this two-part series. The minimum switch time
between the charging and discharging processes of CAES is considered. The whole
model, i.e., the UC model with an accurate CAES model, is a large-scale mixed
integer bi-linear programming problem. To reduce the complexity of the whole
model, three strategies are proposed to reduce the number of bi-linear terms
without sacrificing accuracy. McCormick relaxation and piecewise linearization
are then used to linearize the whole model. To decrease the solution time, a
method to obtain an initial solution of the linearized model is proposed. A
modified RTS-79 system is used to verify the effectiveness of the whole model
and the solution methodology."
54,"Sharp inflaton potentials and bi-spectra: Effects of smoothening the
  discontinuity",http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6093v2,"Sharp shapes in the inflaton potentials often lead to short departures from
slow roll which, in turn, result in deviations from scale invariance in the
scalar power spectrum. Typically, in such situations, the scalar power spectrum
exhibits a burst of features associated with modes that leave the Hubble radius
either immediately before or during the epoch of fast roll. Moreover, one also
finds that the power spectrum turns scale invariant at smaller scales
corresponding to modes that leave the Hubble radius at later stages, when slow
roll has been restored. In other words, the imprints of brief departures from
slow roll, arising out of sharp shapes in the inflaton potential, are usually
of a finite width in the scalar power spectrum. Intuitively, one may imagine
that the scalar bi-spectrum too may exhibit a similar behavior, i.e. a
restoration of scale invariance at small scales, when slow roll has been
reestablished. However, in the case of the Starobinsky model (viz. the model
described by a linear inflaton potential with a sudden change in its slope)
involving the canonical scalar field, it has been found that, a rather sharp,
though short, departure from slow roll can leave a lasting and significant
imprint on the bi-spectrum. The bi-spectrum in this case is found to grow
linearly with the wavenumber at small scales, a behavior which is clearly
unphysical. In this work, we study the effects of smoothening the discontinuity
in the Starobinsky model on the scalar bi-spectrum. Focusing on the equilateral
limit, we analytically show that, for smoother potentials, the bi-spectrum
indeed turns scale invariant at suitably large wavenumbers. We also confirm the
analytical results numerically using our newly developed code BINGO. We
conclude with a few comments on certain related points."

  Oscillatory solutions",http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0308061v1,"Self-consistent system of spinor, scalar and BI gravitational fields is
considered. Exact solutions to the field equations in terms of volume scale of
the BI metric are obtained. Einstein field equations in account of the
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and perfect fluid are studied. Oscillatory mode
of expansion of the universe is obtained. It is shown that for the interaction
term being a power function of the invariants of bilinear spinor forms and
$\Lambda > 0$ and given other parameters, e.g., coupling constant, spinor mass
etc., there exists a finite range of integration constant which generates
oscillatory mode of evolution."
56,"Mode conversion in nonlinear waveguides stimulated by the longitudinal
  bi-harmonic refractive index modulation",http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5224v1,"We study specific features of resonant mode conversion in nonlinear
waveguides stimulated by the bi-harmonic longitudinal modulation of its
parameters, which includes changes of the waveguide depth as well as its
bending (in the one-dimensional case) or spiraling (in the two-dimensional
case). We demonstrate the possibility of simultaneous excitation of
higher-order modes of different parities and topologies with controllable
energy weights. The output mode composition is highly sensitive to the
variation in the input power and detuning from the resonant modulation
frequency."
57,"The Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators with a bi-harmonic coupling
  function",http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7292v1,"We study synchronization in a Kuramoto model of globally coupled phase
oscillators with a bi-harmonic coupling function, in the thermodynamic limit of
large populations. We develop a method for an analytic solution of
self-consistent equations describing uniformly rotating complex order
parameters, both for single-branch (one possible state of locked oscillators)
and multi-branch (two possible values of locked phases) entrainment. We show
that synchronous states coexist with the neutrally linearly stable asynchronous
regime. The latter has a finite life time for finite ensembles, this time grows
with the ensemble size as a power law."

  Heun class",http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07821v1,"We present a bi-confluent Heun potential for the Schr\""odinger equation
involving inverse fractional powers and a repulsive centrifugal-barrier term
the strength of which is fixed to a constant. This is an infinite potential
well defined on the positive half-axis. Each of the fundamental solutions for
this conditionally integrable potential is written as an irreducible linear
combination of two Hermite functions of a shifted and scaled argument. We
present the general solution of the problem, derive the exact energy spectrum
equation and construct a highly accurate approximation for the bound-state
energy levels."
59,"Controlling the long-term dynamics of Brillouin Fiber Lasers using pump
  modulation: Bi-stable lasing and Hysteresis",http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06034v1,"The long-term lasing dynamics of Brillouin Fiber Lasers was recently shown to
be governed by an intrinsic thermal feedback which stabilizes the lasing
frequency at the lower half of the gain line. We show that this feedback can be
utilized by means of pump modulation to greatly control this dynamics.
Specifically, we demonstrate experimentally a bi-stable fiber laser where
switching between lasing modes is possible by either controlling the cavity
length or pump power. An inherent hysteretic response ensures the long-term
stability of the laser in each mode. Excellent agreement is found between the
experimental results and a master-equation based theoretical model."

  Neural Network",http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08370v1,"Deep learning has been demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency in music
genre classification. However, the existing achievements still have several
shortcomings which impair the performance of this classification task. In this
paper, we propose a hybrid architecture which consists of the paralleling CNN
and Bi-RNN blocks. They focus on spatial features and temporal frame orders
extraction respectively. Then the two outputs are fused into one powerful
representation of musical signals and fed into softmax function for
classification. The paralleling network guarantees the extracting features
robust enough to represent music. Moreover, the experiments prove our proposed
architecture improve the music genre classification performance and the
additional Bi-RNN block is a supplement for CNNs."
