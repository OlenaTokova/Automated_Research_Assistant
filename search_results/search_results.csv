2,Evaluating the Success of a Data Analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11907v1,"A fundamental problem in the practice and teaching of data science is how to
evaluate the quality of a given data analysis, which is different than the
evaluation of the science or question underlying the data analysis. Previously,
we defined a set of principles for describing data analyses that can be used to
create a data analysis and to characterize the variation between data analyses.
Here, we introduce a metric of quality evaluation that we call the success of a
data analysis, which is different than other potential metrics such as
completeness, validity, or honesty. We define a successful data analysis as the
matching of principles between the analyst and the audience on which the
analysis is developed. In this paper, we propose a statistical model and
general framework for evaluating the success of a data analysis. We argue that
this framework can be used as a guide for practicing data scientists and
students in data science courses for how to build a successful data analysis."
3,"Elements and Principles for Characterizing Variation between Data
  Analyses",http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07639v2,"The data revolution has led to an increased interest in the practice of data
analysis. For a given problem, there can be significant or subtle differences
in how a data analyst constructs or creates a data analysis, including
differences in the choice of methods, tooling, and workflow. In addition, data
analysts can prioritize (or not) certain objective characteristics in a data
analysis, leading to differences in the quality or experience of the data
analysis, such as an analysis that is more or less reproducible or an analysis
that is more or less exhaustive. However, data analysts currently lack a formal
mechanism to compare and contrast what makes analyses different from each
other. To address this problem, we introduce a vocabulary to describe and
characterize variation between data analyses. We denote this vocabulary as the
elements and principles of data analysis, and we use them to describe the
fundamental concepts for the practice and teaching of creating a data analysis.
This leads to two insights: it suggests a formal mechanism to evaluate data
analyses based on objective characteristics, and it provides a framework to
teach students how to build data analyses."
4,Topological Data Analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08227v1,"Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can broadly be described as a collection of
data analysis methods that find structure in data. This includes: clustering,
manifold estimation, nonlinear dimension reduction, mode estimation, ridge
estimation and persistent homology. This paper reviews some of these methods."
5,Ball mapper: a shape summary for topological data analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07410v1,"Topological data analysis provides a collection of tools to encapsulate and
summarize the shape of data. Currently it is mainly restricted to \emph{mapper
algorithm} and \emph{persistent homology}. In this paper we introduce new
mapper--inspired descriptor that can be applied for exploratory data analysis."
6,Mobile big data analysis with machine learning,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00803v2,"This paper investigates to identify the requirement and the development of
machine learning-based mobile big data analysis through discussing the insights
of challenges in the mobile big data (MBD). Furthermore, it reviews the
state-of-the-art applications of data analysis in the area of MBD. Firstly, we
introduce the development of MBD. Secondly, the frequently adopted methods of
data analysis are reviewed. Three typical applications of MBD analysis, namely
wireless channel modeling, human online and offline behavior analysis, and
speech recognition in the internet of vehicles, are introduced respectively.
Finally, we summarize the main challenges and future development directions of
mobile big data analysis."
7,Categorical exploratory data analysis on goodness-of-fit issues,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09682v2,"If the aphorism ""All models are wrong""- George Box, continues to be true in
data analysis, particularly when analyzing real-world data, then we should
annotate this wisdom with visible and explainable data-driven patterns. Such
annotations can critically shed invaluable light on validity as well as
limitations of statistical modeling as a data analysis approach. In an effort
to avoid holding our real data to potentially unattainable or even unrealistic
theoretical structures, we propose to utilize the data analysis paradigm called
Categorical Exploratory Data Analysis (CEDA). We illustrate the merits of this
proposal with two real-world data sets from the perspective of goodness-of-fit.
In both data sets, the Normal distribution's bell shape seemingly fits rather
well by first glance. We apply CEDA to bring out where and how each data fits
or deviates from the model shape via several important distributional aspects.
We also demonstrate that CEDA affords a version of tree-based p-value, and
compare it with p-values based on traditional statistical approaches. Along our
data analysis, we invest computational efforts in making graphic display to
illuminate the advantages of using CEDA as one primary way of data analysis in
Data Science education."
8,Design Principles for Data Analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05689v1,"The data science revolution has led to an increased interest in the practice
of data analysis. While much has been written about statistical thinking, a
complementary form of thinking that appears in the practice of data analysis is
design thinking -- the problem-solving process to understand the people for
whom a product is being designed. For a given problem, there can be significant
or subtle differences in how a data analyst (or producer of a data analysis)
constructs, creates, or designs a data analysis, including differences in the
choice of methods, tooling, and workflow. These choices can affect the data
analysis products themselves and the experience of the consumer of the data
analysis. Therefore, the role of a producer can be thought of as designing the
data analysis with a set of design principles. Here, we introduce design
principles for data analysis and describe how they can be mapped to data
analyses in a quantitative, objective and informative manner. We also provide
empirical evidence of variation of principles within and between both producers
and consumers of data analyses. Our work leads to two insights: it suggests a
formal mechanism to describe data analyses based on the design principles for
data analysis, and it provides a framework to teach students how to build data
analyses using formal design principles."
9,Self-organizing maps and symbolic data,http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.3587v1,"In data analysis new forms of complex data have to be considered like for
example (symbolic data, functional data, web data, trees, SQL query and
multimedia data, ...). In this context classical data analysis for knowledge
discovery based on calculating the center of gravity can not be used because
input are not $\mathbb{R}^p$ vectors. In this paper, we present an application
on real world symbolic data using the self-organizing map. To this end, we
propose an extension of the self-organizing map that can handle symbolic data."
10,"The Role of Data Analysis in the Development of Intelligent Energy
  Networks",http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.11132v1,"Data analysis plays an important role in the development of intelligent
energy networks (IENs). This article reviews and discusses the application of
data analysis methods for energy big data. The installation of smart energy
meters has provided a huge volume of data at different time resolutions,
suggesting data analysis is required for clustering, demand forecasting, energy
generation optimization, energy pricing, monitoring and diagnostics. The
currently adopted data analysis technologies for IENs include pattern
recognition, machine learning, data mining, statistics methods, etc. However,
existing methods for data analysis cannot fully meet the requirements for
processing the big data produced by the IENs and, therefore, more comprehensive
data analysis methods are needed to handle the increasing amount of data and to
mine more valuable information."
11,Evaluating the Alignment of a Data Analysis between Analyst and Audience,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07616v1,"A challenge that data analysts face is building a data analysis that is
useful for a given consumer. Previously, we defined a set of principles for
describing data analyses that can be used to create a data analysis and to
characterize the variation between analyses. Here, we introduce a concept that
we call the alignment of a data analysis between the data analyst and a
consumer. We define a successfully aligned data analysis as the matching of
principles between the analyst and the consumer for whom the analysis is
developed. In this paper, we propose a statistical model for evaluating the
alignment of a data analysis and describe some of its properties. We argue that
this framework provides a language for characterizing alignment and can be used
as a guide for practicing data scientists and students in data science courses
for how to build better data analyses."
12,A program for SAXS data processing and analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0358v1,"A computer program for small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data processing
and analysis named S.exe written in Intel Visual Fortran has been developed.
This paper briefly introduces its main theory and function."
13,Empowering Data Mesh with Federated Learning,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17878v2,"The evolution of data architecture has seen the rise of data lakes, aiming to
solve the bottlenecks of data management and promote intelligent
decision-making. However, this centralized architecture is limited by the
proliferation of data sources and the growing demand for timely analysis and
processing. A new data paradigm, Data Mesh, is proposed to overcome these
challenges. Data Mesh treats domains as a first-class concern by distributing
the data ownership from the central team to each data domain, while keeping the
federated governance to monitor domains and their data products. Many
multi-million dollar organizations like Paypal, Netflix, and Zalando have
already transformed their data analysis pipelines based on this new
architecture. In this decentralized architecture where data is locally
preserved by each domain team, traditional centralized machine learning is
incapable of conducting effective analysis across multiple domains, especially
for security-sensitive organizations. To this end, we introduce a pioneering
approach that incorporates Federated Learning into Data Mesh. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first open-source applied work that represents a
critical advancement toward the integration of federated learning methods into
the Data Mesh paradigm, underscoring the promising prospects for
privacy-preserving and decentralized data analysis strategies within Data Mesh
architecture."
14,"A Performance Study of Data Mining Techniques: Multiple Linear
  Regression vs. Factor Analysis",http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.5592v1,"The growing volume of data usually creates an interesting challenge for the
need of data analysis tools that discover regularities in these data. Data
mining has emerged as disciplines that contribute tools for data analysis,
discovery of hidden knowledge, and autonomous decision making in many
application domains. The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of
two data mining techniques viz., factor analysis and multiple linear regression
for different sample sizes on three unique sets of data. The performance of the
two data mining techniques is compared on following parameters like mean square
error (MSE), R-square, R-Square adjusted, condition number, root mean square
error(RMSE), number of variables included in the prediction model, modified
coefficient of efficiency, F-value, and test of normality. These parameters
have been computed using various data mining tools like SPSS, XLstat, Stata,
and MS-Excel. It is seen that for all the given dataset, factor analysis
outperform multiple linear regression. But the absolute value of prediction
accuracy varied between the three datasets indicating that the data
distribution and data characteristics play a major role in choosing the correct
prediction technique."
15,"Spectral data analysis methods for the two-dimensional imaging
  diagnostics",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09184v3,"Some spectral data analysis methods that are useful for the two-dimensional
imaging diagnostics data are introduced. It is shown that the frequency
spectrum, the local dispersion relation, the flow shear, and the nonlinear
energy transfer rates can be estimated using the proper analysis methods."
16,Grain - A Java Analysis Framework for Total Data Readout,http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.3364v1,"Grain is a data analysis framework developed to be used with the novel Total
Data Readout data acquisition system. In Total Data Readout all the electronics
channels are read out asynchronously in singles mode and each data item is
timestamped. Event building and analysis has to be done entirely in the
software post-processing the data stream. A flexible and efficient event parser
and the accompanying software framework have been written entirely in Java. The
design and implementation of the software are discussed along with experiences
gained in running real-life experiments."
17,Model-Based Clustering and Classification of Functional Data,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00276v2,"The problem of complex data analysis is a central topic of modern statistical
science and learning systems and is becoming of broader interest with the
increasing prevalence of high-dimensional data. The challenge is to develop
statistical models and autonomous algorithms that are able to acquire knowledge
from raw data for exploratory analysis, which can be achieved through
clustering techniques or to make predictions of future data via classification
(i.e., discriminant analysis) techniques. Latent data models, including mixture
model-based approaches are one of the most popular and successful approaches in
both the unsupervised context (i.e., clustering) and the supervised one (i.e,
classification or discrimination). Although traditionally tools of multivariate
analysis, they are growing in popularity when considered in the framework of
functional data analysis (FDA). FDA is the data analysis paradigm in which the
individual data units are functions (e.g., curves, surfaces), rather than
simple vectors. In many areas of application, the analyzed data are indeed
often available in the form of discretized values of functions or curves (e.g.,
time series, waveforms) and surfaces (e.g., 2d-images, spatio-temporal data).
This functional aspect of the data adds additional difficulties compared to the
case of a classical multivariate (non-functional) data analysis. We review and
present approaches for model-based clustering and classification of functional
data. We derive well-established statistical models along with efficient
algorithmic tools to address problems regarding the clustering and the
classification of these high-dimensional data, including their heterogeneity,
missing information, and dynamical hidden structure. The presented models and
algorithms are illustrated on real-world functional data analysis problems from
several application area."

data refinement steps has been developed: requirements analysis, data
acquisition, analysis, conversion, integration and selection. 800,000 datasets
in DCAT format have been produced."
19,Inferactive data analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06692v1,"We describe inferactive data analysis, so-named to denote an interactive
approach to data analysis with an emphasis on inference after data analysis.
Our approach is a compromise between Tukey's exploratory (roughly speaking
""model free"") and confirmatory data analysis (roughly speaking classical and
""model based""), also allowing for Bayesian data analysis. We view this approach
as close in spirit to current practice of applied statisticians and data
scientists while allowing frequentist guarantees for results to be reported in
the scientific literature, or Bayesian results where the data scientist may
choose the statistical model (and hence the prior) after some initial
exploratory analysis. While this approach to data analysis does not cover every
scenario, and every possible algorithm data scientists may use, we see this as
a useful step in concrete providing tools (with frequentist statistical
guarantees) for current data scientists. The basis of inference we use is
selective inference [Lee et al., 2016, Fithian et al., 2014], in particular its
randomized form [Tian and Taylor, 2015a]. The randomized framework, besides
providing additional power and shorter confidence intervals, also provides
explicit forms for relevant reference distributions (up to normalization)
through the {\em selective sampler} of Tian et al. [2016]. The reference
distributions are constructed from a particular conditional distribution formed
from what we call a DAG-DAG -- a Data Analysis Generative DAG. As sampling
conditional distributions in DAGs is generally complex, the selective sampler
is crucial to any practical implementation of inferactive data analysis. Our
principal goal is in reviewing the recent developments in selective inference
as well as describing the general philosophy of selective inference."
20,Near real-time streaming analysis of big fusion data,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08896v1,"While experiments on fusion plasmas produce high-dimensional data time series
with ever increasing magnitude and velocity, data analysis has been lagging
behind this development. For example, many data analysis tasks are often
performed in a manual, ad-hoc manner some time after an experiment. In this
article we introduce the DELTA framework that facilitates near real-time
streaming analysis of big and fast fusion data. By streaming measurement data
from fusion experiments to a high-performance compute center, DELTA allows to
perform demanding data analysis tasks in between plasma pulses. This article
describe the modular and expandable software architecture of DELTA and presents
performance benchmarks of its individual components as well as of entire
workflows. Our focus is on the streaming analysis of ECEi data measured at
KSTAR on NERSCs supercomputers and we routinely achieve data transfer rates of
about 500 Megabyte per second. We show that a demanding turbulence analysis
workload can be distributed among multiple GPUs and executes in under 5
minutes. We further discuss how DELTA uses modern database systems and
container orchestration services to provide web-based real-time data
visualization. For the case of ECEi data we demonstrate how data visualizations
can be augmented with outputs from machine learning models. By providing
session leaders and physics operators results of higher order data analysis
using live visualization they may monitor the evolution of a long-pulse
discharge in near real-time and may make more informed decision on how to
configure the machine for the next shot."
21,A proposed solution for analysis management in high energy physics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08787v1,"This paper presents an architecture for the analysis management in high
energy physics experiments. Some new concepts on data analysis are introduced.
A protocol for organizing and operating an analysis is raised. A toolkit
following this architecture is developed, which provides a solution of analysis
management with both flexibility and reproducibility. A foreseen development of
this toolkit is discussed."

themes, -- those of tabular data analysis, and the analysis of collected
heterogeneous data. ""Exploratory data analysis"" is taken as the heuristic
approach that begins with data and information and seeks underlying explanation
for what is observed or measured. I also cover some of the evolving context of
research and applications, including scholarly publishing, technology transfer

23,"Ultrametric and Generalized Ultrametric in Computational Logic and in
  Data Analysis",http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3585v1,"Following a review of metric, ultrametric and generalized ultrametric, we
review their application in data analysis. We show how they allow us to explore
both geometry and topology of information, starting with measured data. Some
themes are then developed based on the use of metric, ultrametric and
generalized ultrametric in logic. In particular we study approximation chains
in an ultrametric or generalized ultrametric context. Our aim in this work is
to extend the scope of data analysis by facilitating reasoning based on the
data analysis; and to show how quantitative and qualitative data analysis can
be incorporated into logic programming."

our classrooms. Many of our students need to develop skills in exploratory data
analysis and multivariate analysis techniques for their jobs after college, but
these topics are not covered in introductory statistics courses. This case

25,Online Set-Based Dynamic Analysis for Sound Predictive Race Detection,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08337v1,"Predictive data race detectors find data races that exist in executions other
than the observed execution. Smaragdakis et al. introduced the
causally-precedes (CP) relation and a polynomial-time analysis for sound (no
false races) predictive data race detection. However, their analysis cannot
scale beyond analyzing bounded windows of execution traces. This work
introduces a novel dynamic analysis called Raptor that computes CP soundly and
completely. Raptor is inherently an online analysis that analyzes and finds all
CP-races of an execution trace in its entirety. An evaluation of a prototype
implementation of Raptor shows that it scales to program executions that the
prior CP analysis cannot handle, finding data races that the prior CP analysis
cannot find."
26,Independent Component Analysis for Compositional Data,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00456v1,"Compositional data represent a specific family of multivariate data, where
the information of interest is contained in the ratios between parts rather
than in absolute values of single parts. The analysis of such specific data is
challenging as the application of standard multivariate analysis tools on the
raw observations can lead to spurious results. Hence, it is appropriate to
apply certain transformations prior further analysis. One popular multivariate
data analysis tool is independent component analysis. Independent component
analysis aims to find statistically independent components in the data and as
such might be seen as an extension to principal component analysis. In this
paper we examine an approach of how to apply independent component analysis on
compositional data by respecting the nature of the former and demonstrate the
usefulness of this procedure on a metabolomic data set."
27,Ordered Sets for Data Analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11341v1,"This book dwells on mathematical and algorithmic issues of data analysis
based on generality order of descriptions and respective precision. To speak of
these topics correctly, we have to go some way getting acquainted with the
important notions of relation and order theory. On the one hand, data often
have a complex structure with natural order on it. On the other hand, many
symbolic methods of data analysis and machine learning allow to compare the
obtained classifiers w.r.t. their generality, which is also an order relation.
Efficient algorithms are very important in data analysis, especially when one
deals with big data, so scalability is a real issue. That is why we analyze the
computational complexity of algorithms and problems of data analysis. We start
from the basic definitions and facts of algorithmic complexity theory and
analyze the complexity of various tools of data analysis we consider. The tools
and methods of data analysis, like computing taxonomies, groups of similar
objects (concepts and n-clusters), dependencies in data, classification, etc.,
are illustrated with applications in particular subject domains, from
chemoinformatics to text mining and natural language processing."
28,Scaler mode of the Auger Observatory and Sunspots,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1367v1,"Recent data from the Auger Observatory on low energy secondary cosmic ray
particles are analyzed to study temporal correlations together with data on the
daily sunspot numbers and neutron monitor data. Standard spectral analysis
demonstrates that the available data shows 1/f^{\beta} fluctuations with
{\beta} approximately 1 in the low frequency range. All data behave like
Brownian fluctuations in the high frequency range. The existence of long-range
correlations in the data was confirmed by detrended fluctuation analysis. The
real data confirmed the correlation between the scaling exponent of the
detrended analysis and the exponent of the spectral analysis."
29,Pulling back symmetric Riemannian geometry for data analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06612v1,"Data sets tend to live in low-dimensional non-linear subspaces. Ideal data
analysis tools for such data sets should therefore account for such non-linear
geometry. The symmetric Riemannian geometry setting can be suitable for a
variety of reasons. First, it comes with a rich mathematical structure to
account for a wide range of non-linear geometries that has been shown to be
able to capture the data geometry through empirical evidence from classical
non-linear embedding. Second, many standard data analysis tools initially
developed for data in Euclidean space can also be generalised efficiently to
data on a symmetric Riemannian manifold. A conceptual challenge comes from the
lack of guidelines for constructing a symmetric Riemannian structure on the
data space itself and the lack of guidelines for modifying successful
algorithms on symmetric Riemannian manifolds for data analysis to this setting.
This work considers these challenges in the setting of pullback Riemannian
geometry through a diffeomorphism. The first part of the paper characterises
diffeomorphisms that result in proper, stable and efficient data analysis. The
second part then uses these best practices to guide construction of such
diffeomorphisms through deep learning. As a proof of concept, different types
of pullback geometries -- among which the proposed construction -- are tested
on several data analysis tasks and on several toy data sets. The numerical
experiments confirm the predictions from theory, i.e., that the diffeomorphisms
generating the pullback geometry need to map the data manifold into a geodesic
subspace of the pulled back Riemannian manifold while preserving local isometry
around the data manifold for proper, stable and efficient data analysis, and
that pulling back positive curvature can be problematic in terms of stability."
30,Toward an Android Static Analysis Approach for Data Protection,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07889v1,"Android applications collecting data from users must protect it according to
the current legal frameworks. Such data protection has become even more
important since the European Union rolled out the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). Since app developers are not legal experts, they find it
difficult to write privacy-aware source code. Moreover, they have limited tool
support to reason about data protection throughout their app development
process.
  This paper motivates the need for a static analysis approach to diagnose and
explain data protection in Android apps. The analysis will recognize personal
data sources in the source code, and aims to further examine the data flow
originating from these sources. App developers can then address key questions
about data manipulation, derived data, and the presence of technical measures.
Despite challenges, we explore to what extent one can realize this analysis
through static taint analysis, a common method for identifying security
vulnerabilities. This is a first step towards designing a tool-based approach
that aids app developers and assessors in ensuring data protection in Android
apps, based on automated static program analysis."
31,Object oriented data analysis: Sets of trees,http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.3147v1,"Object oriented data analysis is the statistical analysis of populations of
complex objects. In the special case of functional data analysis, these data
objects are curves, where standard Euclidean approaches, such as principal
component analysis, have been very successful. Recent developments in medical
image analysis motivate the statistical analysis of populations of more complex
data objects which are elements of mildly non-Euclidean spaces, such as Lie
groups and symmetric spaces, or of strongly non-Euclidean spaces, such as
spaces of tree-structured data objects. These new contexts for object oriented
data analysis create several potentially large new interfaces between
mathematics and statistics. This point is illustrated through the careful
development of a novel mathematical framework for statistical analysis of
populations of tree-structured objects."
32,"ROAn, a ROOT based Analysis Framework",http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4848v1,"The ROOT based Offline and Online Analysis (ROAn) framework was developed to
perform data analysis on data from Depleted P-channel Field Effect Transistor
(DePFET) detectors, a type of active pixel sensors developed at the MPI
Halbleiterlabor (HLL). ROAn is highly flexible and extensible, thanks to ROOT's
features like run-time type information and reflection. ROAn provides an
analysis program which allows to perform configurable step-by-step analysis on
arbitrary data, an associated suite of algorithms focused on DePFET data
analysis, and a viewer program for displaying and processing online or offline
detector data streams. The analysis program encapsulates the applied algorithms
in objects called steps which produce analysis results. The dependency between
results and thus the order of calculation is resolved automatically by the
program. To optimize algorithms for studying detector effects, analysis
parameters are often changed. Such changes of input parameters are detected in
subsequent analysis runs and only the necessary recalculations are triggered.
This saves time and simultaneously keeps the results consistent. The viewer
program offers a configurable Graphical User Interface (GUI) and process chain,
which allows the user to adapt the program to different tasks such as offline
viewing of file data, online monitoring of running detector systems, or
performing online data analysis (histogramming, calibration, etc.). Because of
its modular design, ROAn can be extended easily, e.g. be adapted to new
detector types and analysis processes."

biomedical applications. Then, we discuss their important extensions and
generalization to multi-block multiway (tensor) data. We show how constrained
multi-block tensor decomposition methods are able to extract similar or
statistically dependent common features that are shared by all blocks, by
incorporating the multiway nature of data. Special emphasis is given to the
flexible common and individual feature analysis of multi-block data with the

39,Differential Data Analysis for Recommender Systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0894v1,"We present techniques to characterize which data is important to a
recommender system and which is not. Important data is data that contributes
most to the accuracy of the recommendation algorithm, while less important data
contributes less to the accuracy or even decreases it. Characterizing the
importance of data has two potential direct benefits: (1) increased privacy and
(2) reduced data management costs, including storage. For privacy, we enable
increased recommendation accuracy for comparable privacy levels using existing
data obfuscation techniques. For storage, our results indicate that we can
achieve large reductions in recommendation data and yet maintain recommendation
accuracy.
  Our main technique is called differential data analysis. The name is inspired
by other sorts of differential analysis, such as differential power analysis
and differential cryptanalysis, where insight comes through analysis of
slightly differing inputs. In differential data analysis we chunk the data and
compare results in the presence or absence of each chunk. We present results
applying differential data analysis to two datasets and three different kinds
of attributes. The first attribute is called user hardship. This is a novel
attribute, particularly relevant to location datasets, that indicates how
burdensome a data point was to achieve. The second and third attributes are
more standard: timestamp and user rating. For user rating, we confirm previous
work concerning the increased importance to the recommender of data
corresponding to high and low user ratings."
40,"Privacy-Preserving Linkage of Distributed Datasets using the Personal
  Health Train",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06171v1,"With the generation of personal and medical data at several locations,
medical data science faces unique challenges when working on distributed
datasets. Growing data protection requirements in recent years drastically
limit the use of personally identifiable information. Distributed data analysis
aims to provide solutions for securely working on highly sensitive data while
minimizing the risk of information leaks, which would not be possible to the
same degree in a centralized approach. A novel concept in this field is the
Personal Health Train (PHT), which encapsulates the idea of bringing the
analysis to the data, not vice versa. Data sources are represented as train
stations. Trains containing analysis tasks move between stations and aggregate
results. Train executions are coordinated by a central station which data
analysts can interact with. Data remains at their respective stations and
analysis results are only stored inside the train, providing a safe and secure
environment for distributed data analysis.
  Duplicate records across multiple locations can skew results in a distributed
data analysis. On the other hand, merging information from several datasets
referring to the same real-world entities may improve data completeness and
therefore data quality. In this paper, we present an approach for record
linkage on distributed datasets using the Personal Health Train. We verify this
approach and evaluate its effectiveness by applying it to two datasets based on
real-world data and outline its possible applications in the context of
distributed data analysis tasks."

providing a single framework for data storage, event selection, physics and
event display. The new object oriented analysis environment based on the RooT
framework provides a data access front-end for the new data storage scheme and
a new event display. The analysis data is stored in four different layers of
separate files. Each layer represents a different level of abstraction, i.e.

overlooked that analyzing clinical study data also produces data in the form of
results. For example, descriptive statistics and model predictions are data.
Although integrating and putting findings into context is a cornerstone of
scientific work, analysis results are often neglected as a data source. Results
end up stored as ""data products"" such as PDF documents that are not machine
readable or amenable to future analysis. We propose a solution to ""calculate
once, use many times"" by combining analysis results standards with a common
data model. This analysis results data model re-frames the target of analyses
from static representations of the results (e.g., tables and figures) to a data

58,"How Good Is Open Bicycle Infrastructure Data? A Countrywide Case Study
  of Denmark",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02632v1,"Cycling is a key ingredient for a sustainability shift of Denmark's
transportation system. To increase cycling rates, a better nationwide network
of bicycle infrastructure is required. Planning such a network requires
high-quality infrastructure data, however, the quality of bicycle
infrastructure data is severely understudied. Here, we compare Denmark's two
largest open data sets on dedicated bicycle infrastructure, OpenStreetMap (OSM)
and GeoDanmark, in a countrywide data quality assessment, asking whether data
is good enough for network-based analysis of cycling conditions. We find that
neither of the data sets is of sufficient quality, and that data set conflation
is necessary to obtain a complete dataset. Our analysis of the spatial
variation of data quality suggests that rural areas are more likely to suffer
from problems with data completeness. We demonstrate that the prevalent method
of using infrastructure density as a proxy for data completeness is not
suitable for bicycle infrastructure data, and that matching of corresponding
features thus is necessary to assess data completeness. Based on our data
quality assessment we recommend strategic mapping efforts towards data
completeness, consistent standards to support comparability between different

61,Privacy-Preserving Methods for Vertically Partitioned Incomplete Data,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14954v1,"Distributed health data networks that use information from multiple sources
have drawn substantial interest in recent years. However, missing data are
prevalent in such networks and present significant analytical challenges. The
current state-of-the-art methods for handling missing data require pooling data
into a central repository before analysis, which may not be possible in a
distributed health data network. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving
distributed analysis framework for handling missing data when data are
vertically partitioned. In this framework, each institution with a particular
data source utilizes the local private data to calculate necessary intermediate
aggregated statistics, which are then shared to build a global model for
handling missing data. To evaluate our proposed methods, we conduct simulation
studies that clearly demonstrate that the proposed privacy-preserving methods
perform as well as the methods using the pooled data and outperform several
na\""ive methods. We further illustrate the proposed methods through the
analysis of a real dataset. The proposed framework for handling vertically
partitioned incomplete data is substantially more privacy-preserving than
methods that require pooling of the data, since no individual-level data are
shared, which can lower hurdles for collaboration across multiple institutions
and build stronger public trust."
62,Lightweight Knowledge Representations for Automating Data Analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12848v1,"The principal goal of data science is to derive meaningful information from
data. To do this, data scientists develop a space of analytic possibilities and
from it reach their information goals by using their knowledge of the domain,
the available data, the operations that can be performed on those data, the
algorithms/models that are fed the data, and how all of these facets
interweave. In this work, we take the first steps towards automating a key
aspect of the data science pipeline: data analysis. We present an extensible
taxonomy of data analytic operations that scopes across domains and data, as
well as a method for codifying domain-specific knowledge that links this
analytics taxonomy to actual data. We validate the functionality of our
analytics taxonomy by implementing a system that leverages it, alongside domain
labelings for 8 distinct domains, to automatically generate a space of
answerable questions and associated analytic plans. In this way, we produce
information spaces over data that enable complex analyses and search over this

are not given in statistical standard data formats. Data depth functions have
been intensively studied for normed vector spaces. However, a discussion on
depth functions on data where one specific data structure cannot be presupposed
is lacking. We call such data non-standard data. To define depth functions for
non-standard data, we represent the data via formal concept analysis which
leads to a unified data representation. Besides introducing these depth
functions, we give a systematic basis of depth functions for non-standard using
formal concept analysis by introducing structural properties. Furthermore, we
embed the generalised Tukey depth into our concept of data depth and analyse it
using the introduced structural properties. Thus, this article provides the
mathematical formalisation of centrality and outlyingness for non-standard
data. Thereby, we increase the number of spaces in which centrality can be
discussed. In particular, it gives a basis to define further depth functions
and statistical inference methods for non-standard data."

are one such model that has advanced the state of the art in several tasks,
including as image and text generation. In this paper, I train GAN models on
low resource datasets, then use them for the purpose of data augmentation
towards improving sentiment classifier generalization. Given the constraints of
limited data, I explore various techniques to train the GAN models. I also
present an analysis of the quality of generated GAN data as more training data
for the GAN is made available. In this analysis, the generated data is
evaluated as a test set (against a model trained on real data points) as well
as a training set to train classification models. Finally, I also conduct a

the structure and topology of observed data. Topological methods can provide a
way of proposing new metrics and methods of scrutinising data, that otherwise
may be overlooked. In this work, a method of quantifying the shape of data, via
a topic called topological data analysis will be introduced. The main tool
within topological data analysis is persistent homology. Persistent homology is
a method of quantifying the shape of data over a range of length scales. The
required background and a method of computing persistent homology is briefly
introduced here. Ideas from topological data analysis are applied to a Z24
Bridge case study, to scrutinise different data partitions, classified by the
conditions at which the data were collected. A metric, from topological data
analysis, is used to compare between the partitions. The results presented

significantly than the effects present from temperature."
66,Data accounting and error counting,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12583v1,"Can we infer sources of errors from outputs of the complex data analytics

  Bidirectional programming promises that we can reverse flow of software, and
translate corrections of output into corrections of either input or data
analysis.
  This allows us to achieve holy grail of automated approaches to debugging,
risk reporting and large scale distributed error tracking.
  Since processing of risk reports and data analysis pipelines can be
frequently expressed using a
  sequence relational algebra operations, we propose a replacement of this
traditional approach with a data
  summarization algebra that helps to determine an impact of errors. It works
by defining data analysis of
  a necessarily complete summarization of a dataset, possibly in multiple ways
along multiple dimensions.
  We also present a description to better communicate how the complete
summarizations of the input
  data may facilitates easier debugging and more efficient development of
analysis pipelines.
  This approach can also be described as an generalization of axiomatic
theories of accounting into
  data analytics, thus dubbed data accounting.

68,Another Use of SMOTE for Interpretable Data Collaboration Analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12458v1,"Recently, data collaboration (DC) analysis has been developed for
privacy-preserving integrated analysis across multiple institutions. DC
analysis centralizes individually constructed dimensionality-reduced
intermediate representations and realizes integrated analysis via collaboration
representations without sharing the original data. To construct the
collaboration representations, each institution generates and shares a
shareable anchor dataset and centralizes its intermediate representation.
Although, random anchor dataset functions well for DC analysis in general,
using an anchor dataset whose distribution is close to that of the raw dataset
is expected to improve the recognition performance, particularly for the
interpretable DC analysis. Based on an extension of the synthetic minority
over-sampling technique (SMOTE), this study proposes an anchor data
construction technique to improve the recognition performance without
increasing the risk of data leakage. Numerical results demonstrate the
efficiency of the proposed SMOTE-based method over the existing anchor data
constructions for artificial and real-world datasets. Specifically, the
proposed method achieves 9 percentage point and 38 percentage point performance
improvements regarding accuracy and essential feature selection, respectively,
over existing methods for an income dataset. The proposed method provides
another use of SMOTE not for imbalanced data classifications but for a key
technology of privacy-preserving integrated analysis."

analysis, we introduce a hierarchical data (industry and listed company)
analysis method to reduce the impact of noise. For implicit analysis, we
further pre-train GPT-2 to analyze industry trends with current affairs
background as input, making full use of the knowledge learned in the
pre-training corpus. We conduct experiments based on the proposed method and
achieve good industry trend analysis results."
76,First performance measurements with the Analysis Grand Challenge,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05214v1,"The IRIS-HEP Analysis Grand Challenge (AGC) is designed to be a realistic
environment for investigating how analysis methods scale to the demands of the
HL-LHC. The analysis task is based on publicly available Open Data and allows
for comparing the usability and performance of different approaches and
implementations. It includes all relevant workflow aspects from data delivery
to statistical inference.
  The reference implementation for the AGC analysis task is heavily based on
tools from the HEP Python ecosystem. It makes use of novel pieces of
cyberinfrastructure and modern analysis facilities in order to address the data
processing challenges of the HL-LHC.
  This contribution compares multiple different analysis implementations and
studies their performance. Differences between the implementations include the
use of multiple data delivery mechanisms and caching setups for the analysis
facilities under investigation."
77,Leveraging LLVM's ScalarEvolution for Symbolic Data Cache Analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04809v2,"While instruction cache analysis is essentially a solved problem, data cache
analysis is more challenging. In contrast to instruction fetches, the data
accesses generated by a memory instruction may vary with the program's inputs
and across dynamic occurrences of the same instruction in loops.
  We observe that the plain control-flow graph (CFG) abstraction employed in
classical cache analyses is inadequate to capture the dynamic behavior of
memory instructions. On top of plain CFGs, accurate analysis of the underlying
program's cache behavior is impossible.
  Thus, our first contribution is the definition of a more expressive program
abstraction coined symbolic control-flow graphs, which can be obtained from
LLVM's ScalarEvolution analysis. To exploit this richer abstraction, our main
contribution is the development of symbolic data cache analysis, a smooth
generalization of classical LRU must analysis from plain to symbolic
control-flow graphs.
  The experimental evaluation demonstrates that symbolic data cache analysis
consistently outperforms classical LRU must analysis both in terms of accuracy
and analysis runtime."

store, process, and analyze through cluster analysis which helps in identifying
unseen patterns to find the relationships between them. Clustering analysis

  geospatial processes in distributed environments",http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0839v1,"Nowadays, society has recognized that the lack of access to spatial data and
tools for their analysis is the limiting factor of economic development. It
came to the realization that without the single information space, which is
implemented in the form of spatial data infrastructures, a progressive business
development is impossible. Spatial data infrastructures will support a variety
of tasks, which requires the binding of geospatial information from multiple
sources. In the last few years, the rate of progress in spatial data collection
was higher, than in management and analysis of data. Infrastructures allow the
accumulated data to be available to large groups of users, and infrastructure
of analysis allows the data to be effectively used for such tasks as municipal
planning, science research, etc. Moreover, free access to the information
resources and instruments of analysis will serve as an additional impulse to
development of application models in corresponding areas of expertise. The goal
of this paper is to indicate possible solutions to the client-side problems of
spatial data analysis in distributed environments, using the developing
application for data analysis as an example."
81,"A Variability-Aware Design Approach to the Data Analysis Modeling
  Process",http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10176v1,"The massive amount of current data has led to many different forms of data
analysis processes that aim to explore this data to uncover valuable insights.
Methodologies to guide the development of big data science projects, including
CRISP-DM and SEMMA, have been widely used in industry and academia. The data
analysis modeling phase, which involves decisions on the most appropriate
models to adopt, is at the core of these projects. However, from a software
engineering perspective, the design and automation of activities performed in
this phase are challenging. In this paper, we propose an approach to the data
analysis modeling process which involves (i) the assessment of the variability
inherent in the CRISP-DM data analysis modeling phase and the provision of
feature models that represent this variability; (ii) the definition of a
framework structural design that captures the identified variability; and (iii)
evaluation of the developed framework design in terms of the possibilities for
process automation. The proposed approach advances the state of the art by
offering a variability-aware design solution that can enhance system
flexibility, potentially leading to novel software frameworks which can
significantly improve the level of automation in data analysis modeling
process."

in which data DNA, which carries important knowledge, insights and potential,
has become an intrinsic constituent of all data-based organisms. An appropriate
understanding of data DNA and its organisms relies on the new field of data
science and its keystone, analytics. Although it is widely debated whether big
data is only hype and buzz, and data science is still in a very early phase,
significant challenges and opportunities are emerging or have been inspired by
the research, innovation, business, profession, and education of data science.
This paper provides a comprehensive survey and tutorial of the fundamental
aspects of data science: the evolution from data analysis to data science, the
data science concepts, a big picture of the era of data science, the major
challenges and directions in data innovation, the nature of data analytics, new
industrialization and service opportunities in the data economy, the profession

86,Overview of streaming-data algorithms,http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.2000v1,"Due to recent advances in data collection techniques, massive amounts of data
are being collected at an extremely fast pace. Also, these data are potentially
unbounded. Boundless streams of data collected from sensors, equipments, and
other data sources are referred to as data streams. Various data mining tasks
can be performed on data streams in search of interesting patterns. This paper
studies a particular data mining task, clustering, which can be used as the
first step in many knowledge discovery processes. By grouping data streams into
homogeneous clusters, data miners can learn about data characteristics which
can then be developed into classification models for new data or predictive
models for unknown events. Recent research addresses the problem of data-stream
mining to deal with applications that require processing huge amounts of data
such as sensor data analysis and financial applications. For such analysis,
single-pass algorithms that consume a small amount of memory are critical."

  events in biodiversity data papers",http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06215v1,"The data paper, an emerging scholarly genre, describes research datasets and
is intended to bridge the gap between the publication of research data and
scientific articles. Research examining how data papers report data events,
such as data transactions and manipulations, is limited. The research reported
on in this paper addresses this limitation and investigated how data events are
inscribed in data papers. A content analysis was conducted examining the full
texts of 82 data papers, drawn from the curated list of data papers connected
to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Data events recorded
for each paper were organized into a set of 17 categories. Many of these
categories are described together in the same sentence, which indicates the
messiness of data events in the laboratory space. The findings challenge the
degrees to which data papers are a distinct genre compared to research papers
and they describe data-centric research processes in a through way. This paper
also discusses how our results could inform a better data publication ecosystem
in the future."

89,Object Oriented Data Analysis of Cell-Well Structured Data,http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.4767v1,"Object oriented data analysis (OODA) aims at statistically analyzing
populations of complicated objects. This paper is motivated by a study of cell
images in cell culture biology, which highlights a common critical issue:
choice of data objects. Instead of conventionally treating either the
individual cells or the wells (a container in which the cells are grown) as
data objects, a new type of data object is proposed, that is the union of a
well with its corresponding set of cells. This paper contains two parts. The
first part is the image data analysis, which suggests empirically that the
cell-well unions can be a better choice of data objects than the cells or the
wells alone. The second part discusses the benefit of choosing cell-well unions
as data objects using an illustrative example and simulations. This research
suggests that OODA is not simply a frame work for understanding the structure
of the data analysis. It leads to useful interdisciplinary discussion that
gives better results through more appropriate choice of data objects,
especially for complex data analyses."
90,Oseba: Optimization for Selective Bulk Analysis in Big Data Processing,http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03527v1,"Selective bulk analyses, such as statistical learning on temporal/spatial
data, are fundamental to a wide range of contemporary data analysis. However,
with the increasingly larger data-sets, such as weather data and marketing
transactions, the data organization/access becomes more challenging in
selective bulk data processing with the use of current big data processing
frameworks such as Spark or keyvalue stores. In this paper, we propose a method
to optimize selective bulk analysis in big data processing and referred to as
Oseba. Oseba maintains a super index for the data organization in memory to
support fast lookup through targeting the data involved with each selective
analysis program. Oseba is able to save memory as well as computation in

91,Assessing Fairness in the Presence of Missing Data,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04899v1,"Missing data are prevalent and present daunting challenges in real data
analysis. While there is a growing body of literature on fairness in analysis
of fully observed data, there has been little theoretical work on investigating
fairness in analysis of incomplete data. In practice, a popular analytical
approach for dealing with missing data is to use only the set of complete
cases, i.e., observations with all features fully observed to train a
prediction algorithm. However, depending on the missing data mechanism, the
distribution of complete cases and the distribution of the complete data may be
substantially different. When the goal is to develop a fair algorithm in the
complete data domain where there are no missing values, an algorithm that is
fair in the complete case domain may show disproportionate bias towards some
marginalized groups in the complete data domain. To fill this significant gap,
we study the problem of estimating fairness in the complete data domain for an
arbitrary model evaluated merely using complete cases. We provide upper and
lower bounds on the fairness estimation error and conduct numerical experiments
to assess our theoretical results. Our work provides the first known
theoretical results on fairness guarantee in analysis of incomplete data."
92,Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Methods in Climate Data Analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.0537v1,"Linear dimensionality reduction techniques, notably principal component
analysis, are widely used in climate data analysis as a means to aid in the
interpretation of datasets of high dimensionality. These linear methods may not
be appropriate for the analysis of data arising from nonlinear processes
occurring in the climate system. Numerous techniques for nonlinear
dimensionality reduction have been developed recently that may provide a
potentially useful tool for the identification of low-dimensional manifolds in
climate data sets arising from nonlinear dynamics. In this thesis I apply three
such techniques to the study of El Nino/Southern Oscillation variability in
tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures and thermocline depth, comparing
observational data with simulations from coupled atmosphere-ocean general
circulation models from the CMIP3 multi-model ensemble.
  The three methods used here are a nonlinear principal component analysis
(NLPCA) approach based on neural networks, the Isomap isometric mapping
algorithm, and Hessian locally linear embedding. I use these three methods to
examine El Nino variability in the different data sets and assess the
suitability of these nonlinear dimensionality reduction approaches for climate
data analysis.
  I conclude that although, for the application presented here, analysis using
NLPCA, Isomap and Hessian locally linear embedding does not provide additional
information beyond that already provided by principal component analysis, these
methods are effective tools for exploratory data analysis."
93,Virtual Data in CMS Analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0306008v2,"The use of virtual data for enhancing the collaboration between large groups
of scientists is explored in several ways:
  - by defining ``virtual'' parameter spaces which can be searched and shared
in an organized way by a collaboration of scientists in the course of their
analysis;
  - by providing a mechanism to log the provenance of results and the ability
to trace them back to the various stages in the analysis of real or simulated
data;
  - by creating ``check points'' in the course of an analysis to permit
collaborators to explore their own analysis branches by refining selections,
improving the signal to background ratio, varying the estimation of parameters,
etc.;
  - by facilitating the audit of an analysis and the reproduction of its
results by a different group, or in a peer review context.
  We describe a prototype for the analysis of data from the CMS experiment
based on the virtual data system Chimera and the object-oriented data analysis
framework ROOT. The Chimera system is used to chain together several steps in
the analysis process including the Monte Carlo generation of data, the
simulation of detector response, the reconstruction of physics objects and
their subsequent analysis, histogramming and visualization using the ROOT
framework."

space. This survey presents new concepts, methodologies, and applications
scenarios of industrial big data analytics, which can provide dramatic
improvements in velocity and veracity problem solving. We focus on five
important methodologies of industrial big data analytics: 1) Highly distributed
industrial data ingestion: access and integrate to highly distributed data

data analytics: track data provenance, from data generation through data
preparation; 5) Industrial data governance: ensures data trust, integrity and
security. For each phase, we introduce to current research in industries and
academia, and discusses challenges and potential solutions. We also examine the

strengthening model robustness while mitigating overfitting and under-fitting
issues by generating diverse synthetic data. Nevertheless, despite its success
in other domains, data augmentation's potential remains largely untapped in
mobility data analysis, primarily due to the intricate nature and unique format
of trajectory data. Additionally, there is a lack of frameworks capable of
point-wise data augmentation, which can reliably generate synthetic
trajectories while preserving the inherent characteristics of the original
data. To address these challenges, this research introduces AugmenTRAJ, an
open-source Python3 framework designed explicitly for trajectory data
augmentation. AugmenTRAJ offers a reliable and well-controlled approach for
generating synthetic trajectories, thereby enabling the harnessing of data
augmentation benefits in mobility analysis. This thesis presents a
comprehensive overview of the methodologies employed in developing AugmenTRAJ
and showcases the various data augmentation techniques available within the
framework. AugmenTRAJ opens new possibilities for enhancing mobility data
analysis models' performance and generalization capabilities by providing
researchers with a practical and versatile tool for augmenting trajectory data,
Its user-friendly implementation in Python3 facilitates easy integration into
