Title: Assigning AI: Seven Approaches for Students, with Prompts
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10052v1
Summary: This paper examines the transformative role of Large Language Models (LLMs)
in education and their potential as learning tools, despite their inherent
risks and limitations. The authors propose seven approaches for utilizing AI in
classrooms: AI-tutor, AI-coach, AI-mentor, AI-teammate, AI-tool, AI-simulator,
and AI-student, each with distinct pedagogical benefits and risks. The aim is
to help students learn with and about AI, with practical strategies designed to
mitigate risks such as complacency about the AI's output, errors, and biases.
These strategies promote active oversight, critical assessment of AI outputs,
and complementarity of AI's capabilities with the students' unique insights. By
challenging students to remain the "human in the loop," the authors aim to
enhance learning outcomes while ensuring that AI serves as a supportive tool
rather than a replacement. The proposed framework offers a guide for educators
navigating the integration of AI-assisted learning in classrooms
