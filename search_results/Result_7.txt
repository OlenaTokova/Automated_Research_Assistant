  strategy: First-principles study
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01723v1
Summary: By performing first principles calculations combined with Boltzmann transport
equations, we calculate the thermoelectric power factor (PF) of Bi-Sb-Te and
Bi-Te-Se ternary alloys as a function of alloy composition ratio, carrier
concentration, and temperature. The point defect formation energy calculations
also perform to search potential n-type dopant candidates in ternaries.
