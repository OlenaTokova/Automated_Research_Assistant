Title: Enabling human-centered AI: A new junction and shared journey between AI
  and HCI communities
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08460v4
Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) has brought benefits, but it may also cause harm
if it is not appropriately developed. Current development is mainly driven by a
"technology-centered" approach, causing many failures. For example, the AI
Incident Database has documented over a thousand AI-related accidents. To
address these challenges, a human-centered AI (HCAI) approach has been promoted
and has received a growing level of acceptance over the last few years. HCAI
calls for combining AI with user experience (UX) design will enable the
development of AI systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles, intelligent user
interfaces, or intelligent decision-making systems) to achieve its design goals
such as usable/explainable AI, human-controlled AI, and ethical AI. While HCAI
promotion continues, it has not specifically addressed the collaboration
between AI and human-computer interaction (HCI) communities, resulting in
uncertainty about what action should be taken by both sides to apply HCAI in
developing AI systems. This Viewpoint focuses on the collaboration between the
AI and HCI communities, which leads to nine recommendations for effective
collaboration to enable HCAI in developing AI systems.
