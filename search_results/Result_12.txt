Title: AI Failures: A Review of Underlying Issues
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04073v1
Summary: Instances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems failing to deliver
consistent, satisfactory performance are legion. We investigate why AI failures
occur. We address only a narrow subset of the broader field of AI Safety. We
focus on AI failures on account of flaws in conceptualization, design and
deployment. Other AI Safety issues like trade-offs between privacy and security
or convenience, bad actors hacking into AI systems to create mayhem or bad
actors deploying AI for purposes harmful to humanity and are out of scope of
our discussion. We find that AI systems fail on account of omission and
commission errors in the design of the AI system, as well as upon failure to
develop an appropriate interpretation of input information. Moreover, even when
there is no significant flaw in the AI software, an AI system may fail because
the hardware is incapable of robust performance across environments. Finally an
AI system is quite likely to fail in situations where, in effect, it is called
upon to deliver moral judgments -- a capability AI does not possess. We observe
certain trade-offs in measures to mitigate a subset of AI failures and provide
some recommendations.
