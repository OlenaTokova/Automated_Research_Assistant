  discretion? -- A genetic algorithm learns in an artificial market simulation",http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10488v1,"Who should be charged with responsibility for an artificial intelligence
performing market manipulation have been discussed. In this study, I
constructed an artificial intelligence using a genetic algorithm that learns in
an artificial market simulation, and investigated whether the artificial
intelligence discovers market manipulation through learning with an artificial
market simulation despite a builder of artificial intelligence has no intention
of market manipulation. As a result, the artificial intelligence discovered
market manipulation as an optimal investment strategy. This result suggests
necessity of regulation, such as obligating builders of artificial intelligence
to prevent artificial intelligence from performing market manipulation."

ago and the subsequent successes of ""One-shot learning"" in image classification
and ""You Only Look Once - YOLO"" in objective detection. Analyzing the current
development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the proposal is that AI should be
clearly divided into the following categories: Artificial Human Intelligence
(AHI), Artificial Machine Intelligence (AMI), and Artificial Biological
Intelligence (ABI), which will also be the main directions of theory and
application development for AI. As a watershed for the branches of AI, some
classification standards and methods are discussed: 1) Human-oriented,
machine-oriented, and biological-oriented AI R&D; 2) Information input
processed by Dimensionality-up or Dimensionality-reduction; 3) The use of
one/few or large samples for knowledge learning."

13,Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs: A survey,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03499v1,"Artificial Intelligence applications gradually move outside the safe walls of
research labs and invade our daily lives. This is also true for Machine
Learning methods on Knowledge Graphs, which has led to a steady increase in
their application since the beginning of the 21st century. However, in many
applications, users require an explanation of the Artificial Intelligences
decision. This led to increased demand for Comprehensible Artificial
Intelligence. Knowledge Graphs epitomize fertile soil for Comprehensible
Artificial Intelligence, due to their ability to display connected data, i.e.
knowledge, in a human- as well as machine-readable way. This survey gives a
short history to Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs.
Furthermore, we contribute by arguing that the concept Explainable Artificial
Intelligence is overloaded and overlapping with Interpretable Machine Learning.
By introducing the parent concept Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence, we
provide a clear-cut distinction of both concepts while accounting for their
similarities. Thus, we provide in this survey a case for Comprehensible
Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs consisting of Interpretable Machine
Learning on Knowledge Graphs and Explainable Artificial Intelligence on
Knowledge Graphs. This leads to the introduction of a novel taxonomy for
Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. In addition, a
comprehensive overview of the research on Comprehensible Artificial
Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs is presented and put into the context of the
taxonomy. Finally, research gaps in the field of Comprehensible Artificial
Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs are identified for future research."

achieving goals in a wide range of environments. However, widespread implicit
assumption of equivalence between capabilities of AGI and HLAI appears to be
unjustified, as humans are not general intelligences. In this paper, we will
prove this distinction."
15,"Artificial Intelligence Technology analysis using Artificial
  Intelligence patent through Deep Learning model and vector space model",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11295v1,"Thanks to rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in recent
years, the current artificial intelligence technology is contributing to many
part of society. Education, environment, medical care, military, tourism,
economy, politics, etc. are having a very large impact on society as a whole.
For example, in the field of education, there is an artificial intelligence
tutoring system that automatically assigns tutors based on student's level. In
the field of economics, there are quantitative investment methods that
automatically analyze large amounts of data to find investment laws to create
investment models or predict changes in financial markets. As such, artificial
intelligence technology is being used in various fields. So, it is very
important to know exactly what factors have an important influence on each
field of artificial intelligence technology and how the relationship between
each field is connected. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze artificial
intelligence technology in each field. In this paper, we analyze patent
documents related to artificial intelligence technology. We propose a method
for keyword analysis within factors using artificial intelligence patent data
sets for artificial intelligence technology analysis. This is a model that
relies on feature engineering based on deep learning model named KeyBERT, and
using vector space model. A case study of collecting and analyzing artificial
intelligence patent data was conducted to show how the proposed model can be
applied to real world problems."
16,Three IQs of AI Systems and their Testing Methods,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06440v1,"The rapid development of artificial intelligence has brought the artificial
intelligence threat theory as well as the problem about how to evaluate the
intelligence level of intelligent products. Both need to find a quantitative
method to evaluate the intelligence level of intelligence systems, including
human intelligence. Based on the standard intelligence system and the extended
Von Neumann architecture, this paper proposes General IQ, Service IQ and Value
IQ evaluation methods for intelligence systems, depending on different
evaluation purposes. Among them, the General IQ of intelligence systems is to
answer the question of whether the artificial intelligence can surpass the
human intelligence, which is reflected in putting the intelligence systems on
an equal status and conducting the unified evaluation. The Service IQ and Value
IQ of intelligence systems are used to answer the question of how the
intelligent products can better serve the human, reflecting the intelligence
and required cost of each intelligence system as a product in the process of
serving human."
17,"Examining correlation between trust and transparency with explainable
  artificial intelligence",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04770v1,"Trust between humans and artificial intelligence(AI) is an issue which has
implications in many fields of human computer interaction. The current issue
with artificial intelligence is a lack of transparency into its decision
making, and literature shows that increasing transparency increases trust.
Explainable artificial intelligence has the ability to increase transparency of
AI, which could potentially increase trust for humans. This paper attempts to
use the task of predicting yelp review star ratings with assistance from an
explainable and non explainable artificial intelligence to see if trust is
increased with increased transparency. Results show that for these tasks,
explainable artificial intelligence provided significant increase in trust as a
measure of influence."

51,A Study on Artificial Intelligence IQ and Standard Intelligent Model,http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00977v1,"Currently, potential threats of artificial intelligence (AI) to human have
triggered a large controversy in society, behind which, the nature of the issue
is whether the artificial intelligence (AI) system can be evaluated
quantitatively. This article analyzes and evaluates the challenges that the AI
development level is facing, and proposes that the evaluation methods for the
human intelligence test and the AI system are not uniform; and the key reason
for which is that none of the models can uniformly describe the AI system and
the beings like human. Aiming at this problem, a standard intelligent system
model is established in this study to describe the AI system and the beings
like human uniformly. Based on the model, the article makes an abstract
mathematical description, and builds the standard intelligent machine
mathematical model; expands the Von Neumann architecture and proposes the
Liufeng - Shiyong architecture; gives the definition of the artificial
intelligence IQ, and establishes the artificial intelligence scale and the
evaluation method; conduct the test on 50 search engines and three human
subjects at different ages across the world, and finally obtains the ranking of

Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in environmental modelling has increased

increase of complexity better methods are required. Keeping in view of the

53,"A Finite-Time Technological Singularity Model With Artificial
  Intelligence Self-Improvement",http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01961v1,"Recent advances in the development of artificial intelligence, technological
progress acceleration, long-term trends of macroeconomic dynamics increase the
relevance of technological singularity hypothesis. In this paper, we build a
model of finite-time technological singularity assuming that artificial
intelligence will replace humans for artificial intelligence engineers after
some point in time when it is developed enough. This model implies the
following: let A be the level of development of artificial intelligence. Then,
the moment of technological singularity n is defined as the point in time where
artificial intelligence development function approaches infinity. Thus, it
happens in finite time. Although infinite level of development of artificial
intelligence cannot be reached practically, this approximation is useful for
several reasons, firstly because it allows modeling a phase transition or a
change of regime. In the model, intelligence growth function appears to be
hyperbolic function under relatively broad conditions which we list and
compare. Subsequently, we also add a stochastic term (Brownian motion) to the
model and investigate the changes in its behavior. The results can be applied
for the modeling of dynamics of various processes characterized by
multiplicative growth."
54,Creativity and Artificial Intelligence: A Digital Art Perspective,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08195v1,"This paper describes the application of artificial intelligence to the
creation of digital art. AI is a computational paradigm that codifies
intelligence into machines. There are generally three types of artificial
intelligence and these are machine learning, evolutionary programming and soft
computing. Machine learning is the statistical approach to building intelligent
systems. Evolutionary programming is the use of natural evolutionary systems to
design intelligent machines. Some of the evolutionary programming systems
include genetic algorithm which is inspired by the principles of evolution and
swarm optimization which is inspired by the swarming of birds, fish, ants etc.
Soft computing includes techniques such as agent based modelling and fuzzy
logic. Opportunities on the applications of these to digital art are explored."

""What are the limits of intelligence, both artificial and human?"". In this

justifications to state that artificial intelligence has limitations. Thus,
human intelligence will always remain superior to artificial intelligence.
Moreover, we provide justifications to conclude the limitations of artificial
intelligence."
57,"Is Artificial Intelligence Providing the Second Revolution for Weather
  Forecasting?",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16669v1,"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technologies, particularly
in recent years, has led to the emergence of several large parameter artificial
intelligence weather forecast models. These models represent a significant
breakthrough, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical weather
prediction models and indicating a potential second revolution for weather
forecast. This study explores the evolution of these advanced artificial
intelligence forecast models, and based on the identified commonalities,
proposes the ""Three Large Rules"" for their development. We discuss the
potential of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing numerical weather
prediction, briefly outlining the underlying reasons for this potential.
Additionally, we explore key areas for future development prospects for large
artificial intelligence weather forecast models, integrating the entire
numerical prediction process. Through an example that combines a large
artificial intelligence model with ocean wave forecasting, we illustrate how
forecasters can adapt and leverage the advanced artificial intelligence model.
While acknowledging the high accuracy, computational efficiency, and ease of
deployment of large artificial intelligence forecast models, we emphasize the
irreplaceable values of traditional numerical forecasts. We believe that the
optimal future of weather forecasting lies in achieving a seamless integration
of artificial intelligence and traditional numerical models. Such a synthesis
is anticipated to offer a more comprehensive and reliable approach for future
weather forecasting."
58,On a Functional Definition of Intelligence,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09546v1,"Without an agreed-upon definition of intelligence, asking ""is this system
intelligent?"""" is an untestable question. This lack of consensus hinders
research, and public perception, on Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly
since the rise of generative- and large-language models. Most work on precisely
capturing what we mean by ""intelligence"" has come from the fields of
philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science. Because these perspectives are
intrinsically linked to intelligence as it is demonstrated by natural
creatures, we argue such fields cannot, and will not, provide a sufficiently
rigorous definition that can be applied to artificial means. Thus, we present
an argument for a purely functional, black-box definition of intelligence,
distinct from how that intelligence is actually achieved; focusing on the
""what"", rather than the ""how"". To achieve this, we first distinguish other
related concepts (sentience, sensation, agency, etc.) from the notion of
intelligence, particularly identifying how these concepts pertain to artificial
intelligent systems. As a result, we achieve a formal definition of
intelligence that is conceptually testable from only external observation, that
suggests intelligence is a continuous variable. We conclude by identifying
challenges that still remain towards quantifiable measurement. This work
provides a useful perspective for both the development of AI, and for public
perception of the capabilities and risks of AI."
59,Tests of Machine Intelligence,http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.3825v1,"Although the definition and measurement of intelligence is clearly of
fundamental importance to the field of artificial intelligence, no general

researchers are even aware of alternatives to the Turing test and its many
derivatives. In this paper we fill this gap by providing a short survey of the
many tests of machine intelligence that have been proposed."
60,An Approximation of the Universal Intelligence Measure,http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.5951v2,"The Universal Intelligence Measure is a recently proposed formal definition
of intelligence. It is mathematically specified, extremely general, and
captures the essence of many informal definitions of intelligence. It is based
on Hutter's Universal Artificial Intelligence theory, an extension of Ray
Solomonoff's pioneering work on universal induction. Since the Universal
Intelligence Measure is only asymptotically computable, building a practical
intelligence test from it is not straightforward. This paper studies the
practical issues involved in developing a real-world UIM-based performance
metric. Based on our investigation, we develop a prototype implementation which
we use to evaluate a number of different artificial agents."

for the characteristics that widely exist in real-world scenarios. Learning and
optimisation, decision making in dynamic and uncertain environments, game
theory, planning and scheduling, design and education are common research areas
shared between games and real-world problems. Numerous open-source games or
game-based environments have been implemented for studying artificial
intelligence. In addition to single- or multi-player, collaborative or
adversarial games, there has also been growing interest in implementing
platforms for creative design in recent years. Those platforms provide ideal
benchmarks for exploring and comparing artificial intelligence ideas and
techniques. This paper reviews the game-based platforms for artificial
intelligence research, provides guidance on matching particular types of
artificial intelligence with suitable games for testing and matching particular
needs in games with suitable artificial intelligence techniques, discusses the
research trend induced by the evolution of those platforms, and gives an
outlook."

exponential success. The last phase of development showcased deep learnings
ability to solve a variety of difficult problems across a multitude of domains.
Many of these networks met and exceeded human benchmarks by becoming experts in
the domains in which they are trained. Though the successes of artificial
intelligence have begun to overshadow its failures, there is still much that
separates current artificial intelligence tools from becoming the exceptional
general learners that humans are. In this paper, we identify the ten
commandments upon which human intelligence is systematically and hierarchically
built. We believe these commandments work collectively to serve as the
essential ingredients that lead to the emergence of higher-order cognition and
intelligence. This paper discusses a computational framework that could house
these ten commandments and suggests new architectural modifications that could
lead to the development of smarter, more explainable, and generalizable

adversarial examples threatening the Artificial Intelligence and focus on
details of some techniques, which are used for creating adversarial examples.
Adversarial examples are known as training data, which can trick a Machine

hypothesis that machine intelligence capacity can grow autonomously starting
with an intelligence comparable to that of bacteria - microbial intelligence.
The goal will be to demonstrate that rapid growth in intelligence capacity can
be realized at all in artificial computing systems. I propose the following
three properties that may allow an artificial intelligence to exhibit a steady
growth in its intelligence capacity: (i) learning with the ability to modify
itself when exposed to more data, (ii) acquiring new functionalities (skills),
and (iii) expanding or replicating itself. The algorithms must demonstrate a
rapid growth in skills of dataprocessing and analysis and gain qualitatively
different functionalities, at least until the current computing technology
supports their scalable development. The existing algorithms that already
encompass some of these or similar properties, as well as missing abilities
that must yet be implemented, will be reviewed in this work. Future
computational tests could support or oppose the hypothesis that artificial
intelligence can potentially grow to the level of superintelligence which
overcomes the limitations in hardware by producing necessary processing

of job seekers will need financial support while catching up with these novel
unpredictable jobs. This possible job market crisis has an antidote inside. In
fact, the rise of AI is sustained by the biggest knowledge theft of the recent

unskilled workers by analyzing their interactions. By passionately doing their
jobs, these workers are digging their own graves.
  In this paper, we propose Human-in-the-loop Artificial Intelligence (HIT-AI)
as a fairer paradigm for Artificial Intelligence systems. HIT-AI will reward
aware and unaware knowledge producers with a different scheme: decisions of AI
systems generating revenues will repay the legitimate owners of the knowledge

we approach this problem in the following way: We take a number of well known
informal definitions of human intelligence that have been given by experts, and
extract their essential features. These are then mathematically formalised to
produce a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines. We believe

ways in which it may differ from artificial intelligence, by considering the
characteristics of the kind of computational problems that human minds have to
solve. I claim that these problems acquire their structure from three
fundamental limitations that apply to human beings: limited time, limited
computation, and limited communication. From these limitations we can derive
many of the properties we associate with human intelligence, such as rapid
learning, the ability to break down problems into parts, and the capacity for
cumulative cultural evolution."

To compare the potential intelligence exhibited by different cognitive systems,
I use the common approach used by artificial intelligence and artificial life:
Instead of studying the substrate of systems, let us focus on their
organization. This organization can be measured with information. Thus, I apply
an informationist epistemology to describe cognitive systems, including brains
and computers. This allows me to frame the usefulness and limitations of the
brain-computer analogy in different contexts. I also use this perspective to
discuss the evolution and ecology of intelligence."

89,Measuring the intelligence of an idealized mechanical knowing agent,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09571v1,"We define a notion of the intelligence level of an idealized mechanical
knowing agent. This is motivated by efforts within artificial intelligence
research to define real-number intelligence levels of complicated intelligent
systems. Our agents are more idealized, which allows us to define a much
simpler measure of intelligence level for them. In short, we define the
intelligence level of a mechanical knowing agent to be the supremum of the
computable ordinals that have codes the agent knows to be codes of computable
ordinals. We prove that if one agent knows certain things about another agent,
then the former necessarily has a higher intelligence level than the latter.
This allows our intelligence notion to serve as a stepping stone to obtain
results which, by themselves, are not stated in terms of our intelligence
notion (results of potential interest even to readers totally skeptical that
our notion correctly captures intelligence). As an application, we argue that
these results comprise evidence against the possibility of intelligence
explosion (that is, the notion that sufficiently intelligent machines will
eventually be capable of designing even more intelligent machines, which can
then design even more intelligent machines, and so on)."

spacecraft autonomy, realized by artificial intelligence. The breadth of tasks
artificial intelligence could perform on such spacecraft involves maintenance,
data collection, designing and constructing an infrastructure using in-situ
resources. Despite its importance, existing publications on artificial
intelligence and interstellar travel are limited to cursory descriptions where
little detail is given about the nature of the artificial intelligence. This
article explores the role of artificial intelligence for interstellar travel by
compiling use cases, exploring capabilities, and proposing typologies, system
and mission architectures. Estimations for the required intelligence level for
specific types of interstellar probes are given, along with potential system
and mission architectures, covering those proposed in the literature but also
presenting novel ones. Finally, a generic design for interstellar probes with
an AI payload is proposed. Given current levels of increase in computational
power, a spacecraft with a similar computational power as the human brain would
have a mass from dozens to hundreds of tons in a 2050-2060 timeframe. Given
that the advent of the first interstellar missions and artificial general
intelligence are estimated to be by the mid-21st century, a more in-depth
exploration of the relationship between the two should be attempted, focusing
on neglected areas such as protecting the artificial intelligence payload from

  Intelligence Measure",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12047v1,"In 2011, Hibbard suggested an intelligence measure for agents who compete in
an adversarial sequence prediction game. We argue that Hibbard's idea should
actually be considered as two separate ideas: first, that the intelligence of
such agents can be measured based on the growth rates of the runtimes of the
competitors that they defeat; and second, one specific (somewhat arbitrary)
method for measuring said growth rates. Whereas Hibbard's intelligence measure
is based on the latter growth-rate-measuring method, we survey other methods
for measuring function growth rates, and exhibit the resulting Hibbard-like
intelligence measures and taxonomies. Of particular interest, we obtain
intelligence taxonomies based on Big-O and Big-Theta notation systems, which
taxonomies are novel in that they challenge conventional notions of what an
intelligence measure should look like. We discuss how intelligence measurement
of sequence predictors can indirectly serve as intelligence measurement for
agents with Artificial General Intelligence (AGIs)."

starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair
to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the
researchers' intuition of what constitutes a `good' explanation. There exists
vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive
